In three words: Dry and flavorless.

Preferred Geno's, but only because his cheez whiz makes it less dry.

My comparison review of Genos v. Pats:
Despite their poor reviews on Yelp for being over priced, less than spectacular, and staffed by greasy men with the unique streak of arrogance borne of notoriety, we felt that experiencing the origins of the 'steak would be more rewarding than tracking down steakeries more highly regarded by the on-line community. 

So off to South Philly we ventured. We had been warned by other steak hunters that the area inhabited by the legendary steakeries was dilapidated and dangerous- so we were happily surprised to find them located in a vibrant community reminiscent of the San Francisco Mission (except with a lot less Latinos and a lot more Italians.) 

Arriving unmolested, we broke into teams to procure steaks from each of the shops (without out having to stand in both the long winding lines sequentially.) Our team went to Geno's, while Priscilla, Tammy and Sam went to Pat's to pick up our steaks. 
Geno's was interestingly decorated in photo's of the owner and his son posing with scantily-clad, skanky looking women and various celebs, as well as over the top pro-American propaganda and anti-immigrant rhetoric. 

I was warned by a woman in line that I must order our steaks with the whiz. Apparently it caused quite an uproar when John Kerry failed to order the traditional ""South Philly,"" from Geno's- note that Pat's doesn't serve the whiz, so apparently the style only represents the north corner of the intersection, rather than all of South Philly.

When I returned to our seats, team 2 had already procured our steaks from Pats. Apparently some confusion had occurred during ordering, and we now had in our possession 7 steaks- 4 from Pats, and 3 from Genos. 

Both steaks were pretty basic- thin strips of steak with onions on bland French rolls; Pat's came with the traditional Provolone and Geno's with the aforementioned Cheese Whiz.

I started by eating one half of a Pat's steak. It was decent, but uninspiring. Several members of the expedition complained that Pat's Steaks were too dry. While not overly moist, I didn't share their concern; however the flavor was lacking in my opinion. Pat's Steaks were very bland in flavor, reminding me of my own creations before I got down with Montreal seasoning and fresh garlic. The cheese was also lacking in flavor. 

Next, I moved onto a Geno's steak, with the Whiz. I was intrigued by the flavor and consistency of the Whiz; the steak was juicier than Pat's and the Whiz and grease mixed into thin cheese-gravy that soaked the otherwise bland roll. The meat was similarly bland to that of Pat's, but the flavor of the Whiz compensated for the most part. 

I ended up consuming about 2.5-3 steaks in various portions in the sitting, as a excess had been ordered and various members of the expedition were unable to complete their missions, so I feel that I am qualified to end the age old debate as to who makes the best Cheese Steak:

Consensus amongst the group was that Geno's made the better steak of the two, but Geno's lost points due to the quasi-racist vibe, and at least 1 member of the expedition didn't care much for the Whiz. If we had spent more than a single night in Philly, we would have undoubtedly searched for less famous, but more delectable competition, but unfortunately we left the City of Brotherly love disappointed by the over-hyped, over-rated 'steaks. 


Mike's Ratings: (On a scale from 1-5, 5 being perfect and 1 being inedible.)


Cheese Steak Shop: 4.5-5 (Great tasting, but pretty expensive. I require a 15' to fully satisfy my hunger)
Geno's: 3-3.5 (Tasty, also too damn expensive) 
Pat's: 2.5-3 (Very bland, I can do better at home.)


Vanessa's Ratings:
Cheese Steak Shop: 5 (""Yummy!"")
Geno's: 3.5 (""I wouldn't go out of my way to stand in that line & he's racist."")

Driving through those narrow neighborhood streets, can't help but think of Rocky. I really enjoyed Pat's cheesesteaks in the past. They were always juicy and better tasting than Geno's in my opinion. During this trip, I couldn't help but notice the saltiness of their cheesesteaks and cheese fries.

Sure the wiz is straight from a tin can but I found myself extremely thirsty by the time I got back to the hotel. I woke up in the middle of the night just to drink a whole bottle of water. At the time I was eating the cheesesteak, it was delicious. Extremely tender and juicy but everything was indeed a lot saltier than usual, especially the fries.

Verdict - price constantly climbs higher and higher for a cheesesteak in Philly. Despite the saltiness, it was still a fun experience showing my sister in-law Pat's steaks. We all enjoyed it and found parking right away. Speaking of parking, be careful with panhandlers and scam artist lurking around your car at night.

Good portion of meat with some fat in it, not too lean, cooked well. American Cheese was tasty.
I judge a steak by Bread, cheese, and meat. And that's all I want, no wiz, by the way that drives me nut's people actually put something like that on a sandwich. And no I don't want  ""wit"" anything. Not knocking onions, but for a best cheesesteak comparison, not you don't and you can't. You judge them by meat, cheese, bread only, that's it.

So the Steak was good, 4 stars but Sonny's won on our limited comparisons even though we thought Pat's meat was a better quality, Sonny has more flavor, so maybe Sonny is flavoring their meat, which isn't a bad idea, I want a little snap out of the meat but Pat's was decent.

Despite the historic reputation, Pat's cheesesteaks just aren't that great. I'm guessing all the traffic the place gets is from the publicity from food shows, and I'll bet most of the patrons are tourists. For all the PR this place gets, the food is mediocre at best. The meat is a sliced ribeye that is unseasoned and bland. You get a choice of cheese, and the American which I got seemed like Kraft singles. The bread was fresh, and had a nice texture that complimented the meat, cheese and onions, however, the bland and excessively greasy meat was hard to overcome. The arrogant attitude of the employees (which is part of the reputation and charm to some people) is annoying given the quality of the food. Also, the $9 price tag is probably $3 more than what it should cost. The other famous place down the street is Geno's, which I inferring is worse because the lines were considerably shorter.

There wasn't anything wrong with the cheesesteak, I just didn't like the cheese whiz.

Both are far from the tourist scene (ie the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall) so it is a journey to get to either one.  

Philadelphia is apparently known for being rude (so our tour guide mentioned) and Pat's and Geno's live up to the reputation.  The woman at Pat's gave one guy a hard time because he didn't ask for a bag when he ordered.  When I tried to order soda, I was quickly rejected and told I had to go to the next window (sandwiches at one window, soda and fries at another). Geno's had a line and they have little patience if you don't know how to give your order right.

In to the food... we preferred Pat's more than Geno's.  In fact I had to give my husband my Pat's cheesesteak and got stuck with the Geno's one.  

Pat's bread is softer, while Geno's was tougher kind of like old french bread.  The meat at Pat's was a little jucier but more fatty.  Neither had a real good steak taste though.  I got whiz on the Pat's sandwich which gave it a creamy texture, although they were pretty skimpy with it so there wasn't nearly enough whiz. My husband got provolone on the Geno's sandwich and it wasn't even melted.

All in all, I wouldn't go to either place again.  Our tour guide pointed us towards Sonny's which is on Market street (3-4 blocks from the Liberty Bell so wat more convenient). It was also cheaper and way tastier.

Along with that, these are Philly Cheesesteaks- but there are so many better options. Sadly, these are the two that always come to mind though when it comes to philly steaks.

I like the way Pat's is run. I like that Pat keeps his attention on his steak and isn't outspoken/annoying like his counterpart across the street.

Honestly, though, if you're up late and want a steak- go for it. Other than that, there are plenty of other places to get a quality cheesesteak.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Important Facts: CASH ONLY $11 cheesesteak (as of this review)- limited street parking - one window to order your cheesesteak at and then another to order fries/drinks. All seating is covered outdoor seating on red picnic tables. 

THE ORDERING PROCESS
- Very simple - very BRUSQUE - we ain't in the South no more...
Two windows - the one to the right is to order JUST STEAKS.
There's a little bit of lingo with the steaks - it's on their website, but hundreds of people a day butcher it while dealing with the brusque staff so I wouldn't worry about it too much. Something like ""whiz with (wit)"" will get you a cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz (I've always been told whiz is the original cheese topping - if this is your first visit don't you want to be ""authentic?""
Second window you order fries and drinks.
You pay separately at each window. 

They do this because the steaks are more or less ready to go and they want to keep the line moving. They give you a guttural yell of ""next"" to tell you they're ready for the next order. They want you to have your cash money out as you get the window to keep things running smoothly. A cheesesteak is $11 ""whiz with"" (I refuse to say wit - it does not compute to my tongue). By the time I got my change our two steaks were ready.

We passed on the fries and got a soda for $3.50.

My visit to Pat's was the last event during a completely spontaneous trip to Philly from DC - my first ever visit. After spending about 3 hours touring wandering around, seeing the ""Rocky steps"" and hanging out at the Free Library (too cheap to spend $20+ on admission to the many interesting museums in town and too late to see the Liberty Bell) I decided it was finally time to cough up some dough and drove to South Philly.
 
Frankly the whole process was rather stressful. I had read about the ordering process on their website but didn't realize it was cash only until I was nearly there, so I pulled off into a 7-11 and got $40 out of the ATM.

The neighborhood Pat's is in is close quarters with limited street parking and tourists from all 50 states and many foreign countries clogging the streets. After one pass around the block of one way streets I managed to find a spot (it's all parallel parking in case you couldn't guess). The neighborhood is probably not the best, but didn't feel actively unsafe at twilight on a Monday evening. I was asked for money by a guy who looked like Rocky's cousin and then, after our meal was over, we literally were sitting in our car when a man on a bike rode up to a man sitting on a stoop steps from our car and did a drug deal. And no, I'm not guessing, I literally saw him dropping what was probably crack rocks into the other guy's hand. Just second's before as I was walking back to the car I had seen a police cruiser roll by, so the neighborhood is patrolled, probably more than some other neighborhoods due to the potential for crime against clueless Chinese tourists and slack jawed Southerners like yours truly.

As discussed above the service can be a little off-putting to those of us from different cultures of customer service, but I'd suggest adopting a ""when in Rome"" point of view as that's part of the schtick (and local culture by all accounts - look at the Eagles).

Speaking of the Eagles - at 5pm on Monday night most of the customers were wearing Wentz and McNabb jerseys as, unbeknownst to me, Monday Night Football was in Philly that night. I consider that a good sign when folks who have had time to know the area choose to eat at a place like this.

Bottom-line: This is like Cafe Dumond in New Orleans - yes, it's very touristy - it's open more or less 24/7, BUT it's still delicious and if you don't get a cheesesteak from here or Geno's your friends back home will wonder if you really even visited Philly.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star. 

In the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two. 

From the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz.  The combination works well and IMO that is why they're here.

Whether the many 1 and 2 star reviews are from Geno loyalists or those who were merely disappointed by the steak sandwiches in which the two landmarks are both famously known for, I can't say. However, they helped me keep perspective in that this is an old-school joint established over eight decades ago, with an affordable menu created for the working class. So not much creativity and quality in the way everything's put together, but it's good for what it was meant to be. 

The first thing I noticed after unraveling the wax paper was the soft bread. Soft with just the right amount of chew to the bite - good to know that the bread was not old nor stale at 10:00pm on a Thursday night. It was also good for absorbing the steak and cheese drippings. The ribeye was sliced thinly, but there was a lot of it, and it was hot & salty in all its meatiness. Got it with the wiz as recommended and onions. Where it was lacking in flavor (aside from the salt), the wiz really pulled it together and made it quite tasty. 

Yes, I've had far better quality and more flavorful cheese steaks (or steak sandwiches as they call it at Pat's), but for what it is - semi-fast food in an establishment older than most of you and myself - it was really good!

They beat Geno's for a number of reasons:
1. The meat at Pat's felt like better quality of meat than Geno's. We bit into Pat's and felt the texture of the meat, like a real carnivore. Just the right amount of mushroom and onion then loads of meat.
2. The veggies also felt heartier at Pat's. Maybe it's the way they grill it or fry it but the mushrooms were squishy like Geno's, almost a little crunchy and they added more contrast to the sandwich in a good way.

When I was a kid Pats was my steak joint without question. Then I became a food snob and everything changed. Now I agree with most folks that the best steaks in Philly are not at Pat's or Geno's. The better ones are without a doubt at John's Roast Pork, Tony Lukes, Cosmi's and Johnny's Hots - and I'm sure there are others as well.

With that disclaimer, I am also a traditionalist and love going to Pat's for the scene and south philly gruff attitude. For a few years I was a turncoat and stop going to Pat's and instead crossed the street to Geno's. However, I am back to Pat's whenever I want a basic south philly cheese steak.

On my recent visit I was not disappointed - the gruff attitude couldn't be missed. I ordered ""one with provolone and extra onions"". If you don't how how Pat's works, the guy who takes your order and money tells the grill man what you ordered - and it's in your hands in about 10 seconds. So the register guy says to the grill guy ""one provolone with a bush"". So it took me a second to guess what he meant - but I had to ask to make sure. So I ask if ""with a bush"" meant extra onions and he said yes. I told him him I loved it and he understood that I understood and we both had a real good laugh - all the south philly attitude was gone.

So I get the steak and see the pile of onions more in the middle of the steak, rather than spread out - and low and behold it looked like an overgrown ""bush""! Gotta love it!! Next time you go and want extra onions just say ""with a bush"" and see what kind of reaction you get - I know I will.

I ordered 3 sandwiches that evening, and only 1 of them came out correct.

Then I moved to the fry window.  I bought 2 fries, for a total of $9.  Not cheese fries, just fries.  The guy handed them to me, I asked for a bag, he tossed one my way.  I asked if I could get a couple of the cups for condiments and he couldn't have cared less.

It's not that these people were rude, they were ambivalent to my presence and patronage.

The fries were reasonably tasty, but completely cold.  Not worth $9 for two of them though. Arby's curly fries, way better.

The sandwiches... The meat was well cooked, to the point of being dry-ish (not totally dry, but no good drippings or anything) and it was rubbery.  Want a really good cheese steak?  Try Dominic's of New York.  That was good.

I walked from Chinatown to Pat's and Geno's hungry with aching feet and got in not one, not two, but three lines (I'll explain). First off note that both locations take cash only, and that you probably will not be able to get a table. We got our Philly cheese steaks with onions and whiz, since I was under the impression that was what a true Philly cheese steak was. We decided on Pat's first due to the fact that the line appeared to be shorter and moving faster (haha shorter). It took about thirty minutes to get through the line, and we were ready having observed the sign that said to have our order and cash ready, so we step up to the first window and order our Pat's Philly and realize there is another separate line for ordering soda's and fries, which I promptly ran to while my boyfriend waited for the sandwich, two lines 30 minutes. 

We walked a crossed the street and ate our sandwich on the street like animals. My first thought upon eating the cheese steak was I've made a better one at home. The meat lacked any flavor and I felt there wasn't enough whiz (which is strange since whiz actually makes me very sick...taking it for the yelp team today though). 

So now, not hungry, and realizing we stopped making these at home because whiz makes me sick, we stumble a crossed the street to Geno's and for consistency's sake ordered the same sub after waiting another 20 minutes in line. Geno's cooking area is open to the public, as we waited we watched the workers make the subs in a surprisingly clean kitchen. They cranked them out. When ordering we did note the Geno's guy said thanks, and he seemed in a better mood. Geno's meat as most people noted is sliced, rather than shredded, which I did think made it taster. Though it was gawdy as all get out, Geno's in my opinion produced a better sub. The bread at both seemed the same, though my boyfriend thought Pat's bread was better less bready. I also felt Geno's was a better cheese to meat ratio, cheesier, and the meat tasted as if it was seasoned or just a better quality of meat. But having now completed the challenge, I wouldn't go back to either.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Cheese Fries - Crispy and crunchy but the price? $5.50 bro! They don't even stuff the box with fries. It's like half full and then they drown it with wiz. Better fries than Jim's but the price sucks!

Service - Is it just me or nobody in Philly uses gloves to prepare a sandwich?

Verdict - In my book, although I enjoyed my sandwich at Jim's, I consider Pat's the King of Philly Cheesesteaks. I really hate freezing my butt off in the cold eating their sandwiches but it's truly worth it. I prefer midnight runs to Pat's. I hate waiting on long lines for anything and I don't give a rats ass about the flashy lights across the street.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I have seen and heard all the hype over the years and had to see for myself. I struggled with my Yelp rating a bit. The sandwich was a solid three stars with my overall experience adding a fourth star. I decided to try Pat's first (this trip) based on the overwhelming ratings lead Pat's has on Geno's (on Yelp). 

First, the sandwich: 
My experience was very much in line with most of the reviews on Yelp. I ordered mine wit-out and whiz and ordered four other various cheesesteaks for a group I was with (wit). The bun was excellent. Soft, medium density body with a soft yet substantial crust. The bread reminded me of pretzel-bread a bit. 

The meat was OK. There was plenty of it but did not have as much flavor as I had anticipated. The beef was not too wet or greasy but simply lacked any character. I was surprised by this, as you would think the centerpiece of the most famous sandwich in Phily would be more memorable. 

The whiz and bread saved this sandwich for me. The whiz brought the flavor to the experience. I will have to try the provolone version sometime. Oh, the fries were amazing! 

Second, the experience:
My visit was on a Friday afternoon at 12:30pm and it was about 20 degrees outside. Fortunately, there was no line and only a few other people were there. The sign, tables, chairs, location and ordering experience is all very nostalgic and unique. I am still numb at how expensive this place is. Five sandwiches and three fries was over $60. The three fries alone were $13. After being told how much the fries cost, I looked at the guy wondering if he was joking. Nope, he was serious.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Case and point, one of my steaks was a little too dry to my liking and they replaced it no questions asked. You won't get that kind of service at Geno's.

Overall, the cheesesteaks are decent, but not worth the price or the trouble of waiting on a long line. This is more a less a tourist attraction, after all Pat's is credited for creating the original Philly cheesesteak.

Genos may be a tad healthier/leaner, but I think chopped and greasy is the better option - for FAT equals flavor and FOOD IS LOVE!  

2 Questions: Why do I have to wait so long in line now?  Is it because of all the empowered British tourists and their mighty, though thankfully tanking, pound?

In the end we all came to pretty much the same conclusion. Overall Pat's really is the King of Steaks. Geno's decor was overwhelming and gaudy. We did not find the giant picture of a cheesesteak surrounded by flashing neon lights on the roof to be particularly endearing and certainly did not add to the flavor of the sandwiches. The bright neon orange slathered all over every possible paintable surface did not help, either. I greatly preferred and appreciated the understated and unassuming simplicity of the decor (or lack thereof) that we found at Pat's. They still had what looked like the original Pepsi sign with their name. We were also taunted by a 10 year old walking by with a Geno's cup while we were minding our own business, sitting on the curb eating our steaks.

None of us appreciated the blatant politics of Geno's either. For those unaware of the controversy, a few years ago Geno's was sued for having a sign on their window that said ""This is America, Speak English when ordering!!""... While I acknowledge their right to have whatever signs broadcasting whatever politics to which they ascribe, I find the hypocrisy of their Italian heritage coupled with their obvious prejudices to be quite distasteful.

On to the actual food.

The rolls from both place were exactly the same. More bread than meat - first bite: all bread. The onions at Pat's were actually fried, with that caramelized color and flavor I like in my onions (when on a cheesesteak, that is). Geno's onions seemed to have been lightly fried, more from incidental contact. They were still so crunchy that they were almost fresh. Not that I mind fresh onions, but fried onions aren't supposed to have that fresh-onion zing. They're supposed to be fried.

The cheese. I could barely taste the cheese at Geno's. I opted for provolone, while my companions opted for the orange cheese-snot product called Cheez-Whiz. Pat's was generous with their provolone and the steak was hot enough to actually melt it before I was able to sink my teeth into it. Initially my companions did complain about the Whiz oozing out of the sandwich and onto the paper, but after eating at Geno's they realized that having enough Whiz to *taste*, much less have ooze out of the sandwich was a blessing, not a curse.

Finally, the steak. This is the one point that we did have to give to Geno's. Pat's steak was shredded, more or less, which is really the way every cheesesteak I've had is. I have no complaints at all about shredded steak, however Geno's steak was sliced, so it actually maintained the classic ""steak"" texture, more reminiscent of roast beef than typical cheesesteak. This is really more about the style of cheesesteak than the quality. Though Geno's sliced style was a bit tastier, it wasn't what I think of when I think of a true Philly Cheesesteak.

All in all I prefer the cheesesteak experience I found at Pat's King of Steaks. The fries were delicious (though I didn't try the fries at Geno's, I suspect they're about the same), the line moved faster, the onions weren't overwhelming, but just added to the sandwich, the cheese was tastier and meltier, and the whole experienced oozed real, authentic Philadelphia culture. If you want a taste of what Philadelphia really is all about, I'd recommend Pat's King of Steaks.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Pat's is slightly better but neither is great. Much respect to Pat's for being the originator but i think its time to reinvent their classic sandwich. I honestly believe that Great Steak and Fries in shopping malls are even better.

Pat's meat was dry, bread tastes stale, and service was poor. I don't understand it. Iit is quite tough to make ribeye tasteless. I have no idea  how to do it....So pat, please tell me your secret...

Needless to say, it was a big disappointment to come to these 2 tourist traps to fill my cheesesteak craving when on my roadtrip. I ate half a sandwich from Geno's and half from Pat's and int he end, i was still dissapointed and my craving for GOOD cheesesteak was bigger than ever...I should have done more research instead of just going with the most well known places.

And lastly, there is no indoor seating.  They don't tell you that there is, how do you fault them for this?  My wife and I sat outside at 10AM on a Sunday morning in mid-December, after siting outside at Geno's for ten minutes.  We knew what we were getting into and had a blast.

At the end of the day, this was the sort of thing we were hoping for out of all three spots.  The thinly sliced meat, gooey whiz, with onions on some tasty bread.  We got it here.  What separated them from Geno's was the bread, the rest seemed similar to me as a rookie cheesesteak eater.

On Friday night I took a quick trip with my boyfriend who has been here many times and always told me it's a good sandwich but not worth the 3 hr drive. I listened to him but had to see for myself. 

I went around 1 AM and the lines were LONG even though it was raining. I automatically knew this was a tourist spot sort of how the halal guys are in New York. I stood in line listening to everyone talk about what's good and I ended up ordering the pepper steak ""wit wiz"" which means with onions and cheese. 

The service was great, the employees were very nice and polite for the late night serving they had to endure. The place looked clean from what I could see and the ambience was typical sandwich spot. There was outdoor umbrella and chair seating and nice music playing. The menu was posted on the wall with limited options but that's what made it good, you had to order a signature item. 

I ENJOYED my sandwich, it was well cooked and pretty tasty. The bead was warm and the meat was flavored, I think the pepper is what made the sandwich. If I had to do it over again, I would do it without wiz aka cheese. I am not a fan of American cheese and the cheese was sort of like the cheese you dip nachos in at the movies. It was tasty but not satisfying for me.

I think their food is WAY over priced which is a down side. Hey, I get its a tourist spot but what about the locals? Can't they enjoy some tradition for less? Mt sandwich was about $13 for three sandwiches we paid $36 which is a bit much if you ask me. I usually don't watch the price of food if it's tasty but in this case I thought it was robbery.

The neighborhood this spot is located didn't appear to be great but wasn't unsafe. I found parking less than a block away and there were LOTS of people outside so it wasn't a desolate area.

Geno's was good, tidy, almost genteel. A nice mix of  whiz, onions, and meat.

Pat's, on the other hand, won points for sheer abundance. This thing was big. And messy (see photos). With about twice as much filling as Geno's, the flavor of the steak took center stage. I found Pat's to be a bit tastier, probably because the beef flavor came through more clearly. However, the bread was overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed too, with Cheese Whiz, mostly. Too much of the whiz is not necessarily a good thing.

I gave a marginal win to Pat's on the basis of bounty, (and because they had a better selection of condiments and ruder staff), but I would really need to eat a few more steaks to decide on a definite favorite.

Located in an interesting crowded area with lots of characters and across the street from it's rival, Geno's. Came here instead since it had a higher review on yelp and we only had a day to spend in Philly.

 I had the philly cheesesteak (about $8 price) with onions and ate only 1/3 of the sandwich. It was delicious, especially adding their hot sauce and eating hot peppers on the side with it. I love how they have so many hot peppers in the condiments area and a tub of hot sauce for the spicy lovers. mmm. I don't remember the taste of the sandwich anymore which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. I would love to come back here and try it again on an empty stomach. My bf and his family enjoyed it very much though.

Past unpleasantness aside, this place provides a unique experience.  You have to know what you're ordering, specifically.  It doesn't help that the names posted on the menu differ from what you actually have to tell the guy in the window.  You have to have your money out.  If you fail at these objectives, you will return to the back of the line and try again.

Mind you, there are two different windows at this place.  The first window is the one you line up at for your steak.  The second window is where you go for fries, soda, etc.  Make sure not to choke on your sandwich while you're waiting in line for your soda.

The coolest thing of all for me was this: as you wait in line for your soda, look at the ground.

Yea yea, I know it's probably unfair cause they have to make the food quick cause the line is outrageous, but it still affects my experience when I see them making sandwiches with no gloves and dipping their fingers into the cheese buckets.

I'm not in Philly a lot, but when I am, I feel obligated to try the philly cheese steaks. And where better to go than the touristy attraction Pat's or Geno's. They are seriously across the street from each other and the only deciding factor for me was which line was shorter. I don't know which genius decided to continue the line onto the street rather than around the block, but when I got there, both lines were almost touching each other and clearly blocking traffic left and right. A cop had to come by and tell us to shift the line. They probably should have an employee come out once in a while to make sure the line isn't going crazy. 

That being said, while there were like 50 people in front of us, the line moved very fast. Their sign gives you the steps on how to order and at the end it says if you mess up, you have to move to the back of the line. All business, nothing personal. The guy didn't even look at my face when I ordered. Well, excuse you.

A sandwich cost about $10 and I believe it is cash only. Literally 5 seconds after you pay, your sandwich is ready. They obviously make this in bulk. I saw the guy scrape the cheese off the knife with his bare finger and smeared it onto the side of the bucket. I almost didn't want to eat the sandwich.

After I got over the initial shock, I sat across the street on a ledge (hard to find seats) to eat my sandwich. I got a steak with onions and cheese whiz, side of fries and soda. The steak was good, made well-done and sliced pretty thin. The onions I didn't taste at all. But the whiz really made the sandwich. Something about that cheese made me feel nostalgic and very happy. Definitely recommend the whiz rather than the other choices they had there. The bread was also soft and well toasted and went well with the combination. Overall, it was a good sandwich. The fries were crispy and tasty, but they glisten with oil. 

Don't be scared of how long the line looks. It actually moves very fast. And if you stand at the front of the line, you can see exactly why it is so fast. If you are in Philly and want to try some ""authentic"" (I guess? What do I know.) cheese steak, I'd say come to this street and take your pick between Pat's and Geno's.

Here's the deal: this place is way better than Geno's.

I used to run a Monday night party at my place, and every night I would stop by and pick up one steak each from Pat's and Geno's, take them back to my place and slice them into smaller pieces so people could eat them without having to eat the whole thing. I'd remove the labels from them, so nobody would know which was which unless they were familiar with the different rolls used by the two places.

What I noticed after two months of this was that the steak from Geno's would always be half eaten and the one from Pat's was always gone.

So, there you have it... a multi-month, blind taste test that shows people prefer Pat's.

You will, too.

But if you really want a steak, go to J&J Pizza one block north. They make 'em fresh and there's less of a wait.

Oh, and another hat-tip to Pat's (and this is why I'm giving them the fourth star): they are good people. Living on that block of 9th Street is a real pain sometimes. People throw their trash on the ground all the time. The workers from Geno's are the worst at trying to take some responsibility for this, allowing trash cans to get overflowed and being rude to the surrounding businesses. You can tell this because they honestly get about the same amount of business but there are tons and tons of Geno's wrappers, cups and containers all over the place.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

If you have come or thinking about going it's the right place. You will find none better. 

As per the steak. 

Significantly noticeable difference between Geno's and Pats's. The steak at Pat's is simply more flavorful. The minced meat takes in more flavor from the grilling, the onions, and the whiz. 
The roll used at Pat's is nigh softer and more moist than Geno's which leads to a more scrumptious bite. 
The onions used at Pats I believe are a different onion. It seemed to me to be a sweeter onion at Pat's. 


Finally the fries from Pats are similar to Burger King fries. A little bit better in my opinion.

I arrived at my hotel in Philly at 12:30 AM, checked in, and immediately went to Pat's for some famous late night grub. Parking was easy and the atmosphere was fun and lively, particularly for 1 in the morning. Everything was great until I got my ""one with wiz"", a classic, apparently. They slid my sandwich to me about 2 seconds after ordering and before I picked it up I knew it was going to be terrible. 

The bread was stale and hard like it had been sitting out in the open for a few days prior. The onions were hardly cooked but were decent in terms of taste. The meat was the worst part - tasteless and chewy, more reminiscent of a cobbler than a cow. The cheese wiz was hands down the best part. I saw a lot of people dousing their subs in ketchup, a telltale sign of quality, or the lack thereof. I tried it on half of my sub and I'm glad to say it upgraded my experience from horrible to slightly horrible. 

I left Pat's asking myself how the hell could this be famous? Who likes this stuff?? It was a strange combination of anger and sadness. Perhaps I hyped myself up too much. Perhaps I should have tried it during the day, or earlier in the night. 

The kicker? I went to a Wawa the next day and had a cheesesteak that was way better, like not-even-close better. I now equate Pat's with McDonald's. Well-known? Absolutely. Good? No.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

For all the hubub of chowing down on a genuine philly cheesesteak, nothing really jumped out when eating the real deal. You get your regular rib-eye beef, sliced thin and grilled on a flat top, toss it on a hoagie, add cheese and some onions, and you're done. It took about 2 seconds from order to delivery - pretty quick. For that speed, the steak isn't wrapped and the diced onions are flying all over the place.

Another first, in addition to the cheesesteak: the first time I saw economy sized cans of cheesewiz. No joke. They were huge!

As my review of Geno's states I visit Philly 2 times a month for business so naturally I wanted to hit all the steak joints and decide who was better between the two. In my answer in the eternal ""Team Geno vs. Team Pats"" I would have to say: Who cares?

EXPERIENCE: Like Geno's, it's a heavy tourist trap- just not that the neon lights and sirens. Plain and simple. Is that a bad thing? Maybe for locals but no it just means that if you are planning to visit- be prepared to wait. The workers are somewhat better than Geno's (sorry to compare) but no one was embarrassed while trying to gain info on the menu. It was busy as expected and it is nestled in a busy part of city. 

!!!Be prepared to search for parking!!! 

FOOD: It was good- steak is well done- roll wasn't necessarily fresh but not stale. But for $10 .. It should really knock my socks off. They are making money hand over fist, but if I want to pay $10 for an average sandwich, I'll sit in Citizens Bank Park and watch a ball game too.

So, in my continued best-cheesesteak quest, Pat's left me wanting.  I've got a list going which makes me legit (please read that sarcasm).

To preface, I base this rating simply on a cheesesteak comprised of steak, bread and provolone.

And, just to up my scientific validity, I've had a trend of only eating cheesesteaks when I am famished: half in the car and half at home.

Pat's was no different.  I had just made my epic return to the gym and hadn't eaten for 7 hours.  So on my way back to my place I swung by Pat's.

Plus? No line.  Minus? No line at dinner time can't mean anything good.

So I ordered my steak (apparently it is a provey without ... or some jargony phrase like that).  Took it back and began to inhale the first half.  The construction of the sandwich was bread, slices of provolone, and then chopped up meat on top on the provolone.  And I gotta say, the meat was tough, kinda flavorless, and I definitely got a big 'ol chunk of gristle (which is a total dealbreaker for me).  The bread was decent, but I still think that if you're gonna chop your meat, take the time to mix in that cheese (a la Dalessandro's in Manayunk). To top off the mediocrity, this thing was a big f'in greaseball and I now have a grease-stain the size of Texas on my pants (so, make sure your paper is wrapped well around the sandwich if you decide to order one here).  At $8.50 the size was decent, but not the biggest steak on the block (and yes, I am a size queen). 

At the end of the day, Tony Luke's is still the front runner by a long-shot.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The walk was interesting, started with nice brick apartments, and gradually into the Hispanic section, with shops extended to the streets. Ghetto woodwork shelving, dirtyish streets with a hint of ghetto aesthetics.  Reminded me of Chinatown, NY with a twist.

I saw a taco/fajita place right before Genos and I wish I stopped there, it looked good.

Immediately after scarfing down Genos Cheesesteak, I walked to Pats for my back-to-back. Pats does not have all the flashy lights and waste of electricity, one of which screamed food first, publicity second. 

 I like. 

I should have ordered the identical cheesesteaks but I got Pats wit wiz and it was a good choice. What I liked about Pats was their style of steak, it was not deli style slices, but chopped and mixed around. It added body to the cheesesteak and makes the overall experience better in terms of chewing and taste. 

The bread was also softer and easier to eat, Geno's was too dense. 

After ordering I saw a group of 8-9 walk up and order. Three customers already eating.

Overall, Pats wins over Genos because of their ""hole in the wall"" look, bread, and style of steak which did not fatigue my jaw.

The cheesesteak itself was decent, but I was cheesesteak'd out when in Philly & tasted better sandwiches at non-tourist spots. The drinks are expensive here - so you can definitely pack some drinks in a backpack or something prior to coming here. It's all outdoor picnic seating so no biggie!

But I feel it must be pointed  out  that that these are NOT direct reviews of Pat's that state a  standard restaurant criteria. Example: food, drinks, service, price, atmosphere, etc,
The unique, and likely unfair, characteristics of these reviews is that they have a division/competition between out-of-towners/tourists and Philadelphia residents.
Additionally, another large portion pits Pat's directly against Geno's! 
Neither of these situations seems fair or appropriate when giving an honest and concise opinion of a single establishment.

The two seduced tourists into their grasp, charging them obscene prices for standard steaks. While Geno ruled his his garish establishment with cruelty and malice, Pat chopped his steak, making it more palatable for his subjects. With this advantage, Pat went mad with power, declaring himself The King of Steaks. The wiser inhabitants of the land knew this couldn't be true, as the men called Jim and Tony Luke were surely more qualified.

I had just made an exodus from my hometown of two decades and finally made a wild whim decision that I would go into film which ultimately led me to moving to either the West Coast or East Coast. Seeing that I did not have that much of a support system out West, my best friend who was originally from Philadelphia had been living in Chicago the past year and had moved back home. He offered an invitation to move out to Philly with him and his mom (rent free, the best kind) while I began applying for Temple University's film program (Bill Cosby speaks at every commencement ceremony, that alone is worth it!).

Low and behold I fell in love with Philly right away. Being of the mold of broad shoulders and big portions, Philly suited me well and my Chicagoan personality. The first time I rolled up to Pat's it had to be around 3am but the line was winding around the block. Right away I saw there was gonna be something special with the plain Jane decor compared to the more flamboyant Geno's across the street. Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Whiz (ya gotta try it at least once man, don't knock it till you try it), tons of sliced beef steak on a hoagie roll **drool**.....

OMG.... yeah it's like that. Never the less Temple didn't end up happening as I got a scholarship offer to a school that I ended up hating and ultimately a few years later I would end up back in Chicago dreaming about those Philly nights (blunts, brews, and other b's). Yuengling I also found to be a great complimentary beverage with a nice fresh cheese steak (Yuengling the oldest American brewery, great pilsner brews).

To be honest, I just loved the overall experienced of eating two different types of cheese steaks back to back. 

To me, cheese steak by all ways and means is heavenly. Who doesn't like a hero filled with freshly cut thinly sliced steak drowned in cheese and grilled onions? If calories weren't real, I'd check the cheese steak box for lunch every day.

What they've set up on the corners of these two streets is a purely genius business model. They basically put the exact same restaurant across the street from each other and created an incredibly intense rivalry. Each side has their own fanboys and loyal locals, but everyone comes for the famous duel. Who has more pictures of baseball players, celebrities, and fire fighters? Who has better cheese steak? Who has better whiz cheese? How fast can you order?

To me, both of these sandwiches are absolutely fantastic. I personally prefer Pat's over Geno's because the texture overall was more juicy.

Nothing has changed through all those years.  Pat's may be the worst cheesesteak in all the city.

There are four types of people who prefer Pat's.

First, those who are loyal to a brand.  Maybe they were just brought on Pat's and they stuck with it.  This is not much different than the Coke v Pepsi situation.

Second, those who actually like Pat's steaks.  This is a small number of people I am sure, but they do exist.  Some people actually like Little Debbie's.  

Third, politically correct, leftist, haters who don't like the food, but go to Pat's just to tell their leftist, PC friends that they didn't eat at Geno's. 

Fourth, hostile illegal immigrants with a chip on their shoulder who think the world revolves around them.

Fifth, tourists who don't know any better.

Pat's cheesesteaks are tasteless, undersized and come on a plain, squishy roll that tastes like it was made by Wonder.  There is just nothing to recommend about it.

Maybe the worse thing is that Pat's is usually dirty.  Look across the street at Geno's.  It is spotless.  At Pat's you never know what you might catch.

On second thought, the worst part is that tourists come here expecting to get a real, top quality cheesesteak and end up with perhaps the worst possible example.

The second time of my life eating a cheesesteak while on my trip in Philadelphia. I laughed because its rival: Geno's Steak, was indeed right across the block! After discussing with a friend, we have decided to eat at Pat's King of Steaks. 

I ordered the original cheesesteak with cheesewiz sauce. Compared to the first cheesesteak experience, which I ordered with no onions, this one was tasted better because of the onions. I liked how it was cooked and gave a nice crunchy texture.

Without Geno's next door, Pat's wouldn't exist. They are like two greasy forces that summoned each other into being, their illusory rivalry little more than a ploy to attract us. Geno's sucks considerably more, but Pat's still sucks. Yet we need both.

Geno's gives us something to revile and judge, yet we must patronize to judge. Pat's is defined in opposition to this: it's less bad, not to mention venerable and unpretentious next to the tawdry neon facade of Geno's. But in a universe without Geno's (dare we fantasize?) Pat's would have to be considered on its own merits--an unremarkable, overpriced, dive trading on nothing more than a boring heritage.

Pat's can boast that they actually put a decent quantity of fillings in their sandwich. They can swagger around knowing that they actually saute their onions rather than merely steaming them. Even in the category of snot-like synth-cheese, Pat's delivers a thicker and more robust slime... they're like a 20W-50 to Geno's 5W-20. The steak at Pat's is also obliterated a bit more, which makes it less leathery and almost flavorful.

None of this is to say that Pat's serves a good sandwich--they don't--but, thanks to Geno's, we come to realize that it's a tolerable sandwich.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Slices of beef are thin and moist with the cheese whiz sauce. I tried Geno's the other day, and I can say with confidence that this is much better.

So we finished our steak and walked across the street to Pat's, what a world of difference, like coming from the glitzy Vegas strip to old school Fremont street, this place had more character like a well worn perfectly fitting jacket. My wife did the ordering this time and she stumbled as well but the person at the counter told her it was all right  and told her how to order correctly. the steak came out a little under seasoned but with the right amount of cheese and the same soft roll. I'm sure if there was a little more seasoning that day, it would be just as tasty as Geno's.

So my verdict on the debate, If you had to eat at one, go to Geno's but make sure you order correctly otherwise you'll feel like an outcast, then 
take that steak and sit over at Pat's for the friendly atmosphere. But this was just one visit to either location, I need to go back again and have a couple more steaks if not for hungers sake.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The cheesesteak at Pat's was definitely very cheesy, with whiz that slightly overpowered the flavor of the shreadded meat. Those who prefer cheesiness will probably favor Pat's while those who enjoy the steak part of the sandwich will probably prefer Geno's. If you're a cheese fan, get it at Pat's whiz with - you'll be very well rewarded for your love of whiz.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Seriously the whole flight over from the West Coast all I could think about was getting a cheesesteak.  I was seriously obsessing. 

Anyway, meandering around in my rental in South Philly, a wonderfully traumatic experience in itself - I expected Rocky Balboa to emerge from around the corner - I was intent on going to Jim's Steaks since the online reviews I had read were most complementary, I never made it that far.  As it happened that evening East Passyunk Ave was blocked off a bit north of Geno's and Pat's.  I said to heck with it, turned around (quite a feat in that neighborhood), barely found a parking spot at 9pm on a Sunday evening and indulged in my first Philly Cheesesteak ever at Pat's.

I got a cheese wit out and American.   It was, to exaggerate only slightly, a religious experience.  The taste of the cheesesteak is fabulous and the bread was soft, slightly toasted.  In short - I loved it.  My only mis-steak, so to speak, was not ordering two as frankly after a long flight and days of yearning for cheesesteak one was really not enough.  Or at least an ""extra cheesesteak"" with the extra load of meat might have been enough. 

The line truly is fast, fast, fast - it just whips.  Seriously, in seconds you have your cheeseteak - it's that quick.  As for those asking if they take charge cards, I don't believe they do, probably mainly to keep the line moving.  I didn't see any Visa/MC/AMEX signs around so I went to an ATM just across the street.  

Overall, a great eat, worth the experience of going to South Philly and eating the genuine article.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Reason's why Pat's is the BEST:
*Everything served is really tasty
*It is THE oldest cheese steak place (founded by Pat Olivieri in 1930)
*It does not have affiliations with Joe Arpaio
*It's adorable and makes me really happy--especially when I think about the long lines after an epic Phillies game

My husband is from PA and insisted on taking me here during our short visit even though he warned me that it was a touristy spot.  

Well, it was a very pleasant experience, and the cheese steak was good!  When he told me that he was going to ask for it ""wit wiz"" - which means with onions, and cheese whiz, I was horrified at the thought. Cheese whiz?!? On a cheese steak?! Turns out, that was my favorite part! It was melted and warm, and very similar to nacho cheese, although I'm sure I just offended numerous Philly natives.. 

So the cheese and onions were good, but the steak itself was pretty bland.  You eat it together, though, so it's still okay... but if you get a bite without any of the cheese or onions.. then it's not so good.

Overall, I'm glad I came. The cheese steak was still good in the end, and it was a fun experience.  If I ever pass right by it, I might come again, but I'm not going to drive out of my way through traffic or anything to make it back.

Cash only, though.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

In my opinion, the steak here was a bit chewy, but very tasty. I definitely liked the fries here at Pat's better than at Geno's. The steak at Pat's is chopped, where the steak at Geno's is diced up into cubes. I enjoyed the sandwich at Geno's better, and the bread was very good too! There is not much meat used at both Pat's and Geno's, but Pat's did seem to give you more, and it's the way it was first served many decades ago.

In my honest opinion, I would rather go for the roast pork sandwich at DiNic's. The DiNic's sandwich was loaded with more meat and was just much more flavorful in general. 

Now don't get me wrong, I did like Pat's cheese steak. I got mine wit onions and whiz. Make sure you know how to order when you get up to the window, as they might give you a bad time. You can simply just read the instructions on the wall next to the order counter for a quick lesson on how to order. Make sure you have your money out as well. The line moves quickly because they want to get people in and out since the place is so popular. My cheese steak was plopped onto the counter within 10 seconds of the order coming out of my mouth! 

Now on to the actual review of the food. I thought the bread was great, however the ratio of steak to bread seemed a bit off. There was an abundance of bread with not enough steak to balance it out. When a sub is this popular, I want some steak and some bread with every bite! I wasn't really into the several bites of soggy bread that I got. The steak was flavorful and the whiz and onions were a tasty addition.  

Expect long lines and the possibility you may not get a place to sit. If you are coming here when the weather is cold, they DO NOT have indoor seating. No cards are accepted, they accept CASH ONLY. If you want fries or a drink, you will have 2 different lines you will need to stand in.

So all that being said, I still don't know what all the hype is about. It was a good sandwich, but I could probably find something at least somewhat comparable in my hometown. I think a big part of the allure is that it is known as one of the original cheese steaks and it is just fun to try these types of historical places.

What scam.  Simpy put this place is only slightly better than the atrocious Geno's accross the street.  Too bad there isn't one more steak place on the other corner it could be known as the Bermuda Triangle of Philly Hell.

This was my second time to PA in the last 10 years years.  The first time I went to place closer to Valley Forge.  That was OK but didn't leave a lasting impression.   

The bread stunk, the meat was dry and sparse.  No flavor!  And $10 a pop, what rip off!  In Chicago if your beef (which is huge BTW) costs more than $6 people complain a lot!

So I'm from the Midwest, not terribly far from Chicago.  Sorry Philly but you got nothing on Chi town and certainly nothing on beef sandwiches.  The beloved Chicago Italian Beef (pick your place, Al's #1, Johnnies, even the chain Portillos) beats the Philly cheese so completely if I lived in Philly I'd mail order from Chicago instead!

Don't waste your time at either of these places.  It's just a tourist trap (now I know!).  Instead go to John's Roast Pork where the pork is on a par with Chicago and I presume the cheese steak is also good.

To experience and give my two cents on the great debate on which  of the two iconic Philly cheesesteak places is better ... Pat's or Geno's. 

Before we left Philadelphia, we headed to both places, and because parking was difficult, my friend drove around to look for a spot , while I patiently stood in a loooong line ( at both places) to get my hands on the iconic sandwich . I ordered 6 sandwiches from both places to split with my friend , to bring back home and to devour in the car on our drive back to the DMV. 

Tip.... Before you even stand in line , make sure you know how to order what you want... Order like a pro and not like some newbie and have people behind you give you THE LOOK... say how many, WID OR WIDOUT (meaning with or without onions) , and if CHEEZEWHIZ, provolone or American cheese...,when my turn came, I said it like a pro - 6, WIDOUT, CHEEZEWHIZ! (Thank God for Yelpers' tips who came before me!!)

The verdict? Well, while I found the competitor's shop to be more hip and actually cleaner,  and their  bun better, I felt Pat's sandwich to be the better of the two... The meat to bread ratio was substantial, the cheeze whiz oozing so beautifully , the beef was not dry and was actually flavorful because of the fat marbling. The competitor had their meat arranged on the bun, as if each slice of meat was counted.....at Pat's the meat was piled on generously! It made for a heavier sandwich I felt. 

Try Pat's and even the other guy across the street when you make a trip to Philly, especially if it's your first time there and your touring the place so you can have a say on this great debate.......But if you're out for a gooood Philly cheesesteak, the locals recommend other places much better. In fact we have some good ones too here in the DMV area, but not iconic like Pat's and Geno's. 

By the way , why I'm giving four stars? Pat's deserves it for being OG!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

savor the bread, because it's one of the reasons a ""Philly"" is the real deal here. that means a tad crusty on the outside, warm, soft & chewy on the inside. that means fresh baked bread like you only find in the northeast, not the wonder bread crap other people are used to. a steak from Pat's tastes great with grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers & ""Wiz"".  there's chicken or no meat if you wish to expand/limit your options, but there's no excuse for even a vegetarian to not eat here at least once. 

have a coke to wash it all down/aid with digestion. don't count on getting a seat at one of the outside tables. if you do get a seat soon as you're done eating get your lazy butt up and move on so someone else can sit. that's right - welcome to Philadelphia. be sure to get plenty of napkins and have a few hot cherry peppers on the side. 

for the Teabagger peoples: if you want to order ""in English"" try Geno's across the street. they'll be happy to accommodate you.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The bread is good. These steak places all take pride in sourcing their rolls locally. I liked the taste of the steak here but it wasn't stove hot. Not sure why, because the turnover is so high nothing should be sitting back there getting cold.  As someone else said, you just finish your sentence ordering, and the steak is there waiting for you. Steak only lukewarm.  Fries stone cold.  WTF?  Going to ding them on food temp, but I'd give them another chance.  

Woe Unto Him who asketh for fries at the steak window. Authentic rudeness at no extra charge - laughed it off, as the rudeness is part of the experience.

And the winner is Pat's....by a long shot.  For this review, I want to describe only Pat's Cheesesteak sandwich and I'll have a separate review for Geno's.  We arrived at Pat's around 11am and there wasn't any huge lines.  I ordered the cheesesteak ""wit"" whiz, which is chopped steak with grilled onions and cheeze whiz on a french roll (maybe italian). The order came out to around $8. The people who worked there were very cool and nice...no-nonsense type of guys.  There was even a cop sitting back there, chillin' with some of the employees.  Back to the cheesesteak, it was very good.  The steak was nicely seasoned and chopped up, the onions were nicely grilled, and the cheese whiz was thick but fluid.  I liked the roll as well but I can't say if it was french or italian bread.  I really liked the different textures...it was soft inside and had a nice crunchy outside.  After sharing some of my Pat's cheesesteak with my wife, I went to Geno's and came back to the car to share it with my wife also. After eating maybe a third of the Geno's cheesesteak, I went back to Pat's to order another one to take home.  I told the guy that his (Pat's) was better and he said, ""it's ok, they got the pretty lights over there.""  But yeah, Pat's reigns supreme in my eyes regarding who has the best Philly Cheesesteak on this block.

I got my cheesesteak ""wit"" and there were plenty of peppers and onions to go along with the thinly cut steak and cheese wiz. The soft bun was nice and it's a good size hoagie. All in all, the steak itself was a little lacking and I couldn't help but think, I don't so much like cheese wiz. It's my own fault, I wanted it authentic...

I think I'm the opposite of my Yelp friend Liz T. on this one though. I think it was well worth the cab fare to check this off my culinary bucket list. I've been to the original Ben & Jerry's in Burlington, where you can get 'seconds' for a buck - the pints they ruined with too much chocolate or something; Pepe's Pizza in New Haven, AKA Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, the best pizza on earth; and the original Starbucks in Seattle, which I'll put on the b-list for quality, but it is legendary and the only Starbucks with any originality in terms of decor.

We did the typical tourist thing and tried Geno's and then Pat's and I have to say Pat's won me over. It's all about the steak and the whiz and Pat's does it right! They don't solely rely on the cheese or onions to give the sandwich flavor and truly focus on the seasoning of the meat. 

For someone not from the area and not familiar with the proper way of ordering, they had a helpful little sign outside by ""I.M. Hungry"" (haha) on how to order a cheese-steak. The staff were considerably nicer and weren't rude or in a hurry to get you out of the line. 

It did not receive 5 stars because there was less whiz on my cheese-steak than I wanted.

A philly cheese steak ranges from $9-11(?), depending on what toppings you include on your sandwich. I ordered their Mushroom Philly cheese steak with onions & cheese whiz. It was pretty darn good. They offer condiments and picked peppers on the side which complements well with the sandwich!

They said it was Johns Roast Pork so that's where we went. Johns is listed as #1 for Cheese steak in Philly even though their signature sandwich is a pork sandwich. All I can say about that is read my review on them and walk the other way. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. OH MY GOD IT WAS HORRIBLE. DO NOT GO THERE. GOD, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! GROSSNESS.

Anyway, we headed across town and since Genos and Pat Kings are literally 50 feet from each other we ordered a sandwich from each. IMPORTANT: CASH ONLY!

At Pat Kings we ordered a steak, onion and sharp provolone sandwich. The service was Soup Nazi casual. We wanted fries, but were so intimidated by the guy that opened the window a whole 2 inches wide that we forgot to order them. The place is a little dull with fading pictures of celebrities that had been there over the years. It made us sad to see these iconic photos fading away. 
 
From Genos we ordered a steak, onion and ""whiz"". Their place is bright, shiny and flashy with lots of neon.  They also have pictures of famous visitors that are well taken care of and they have an impressive display of police patches from all over and a tribute to a local fallen police officer. 
Their service, while a little cold, was at least amusing. We heard someone ask if they had mustard and someone yelled ""For What?!!!"" I guess they don't think their sandwich needs condiments. They have the ""When ordering speak English"" signs and the freedom fries on the menu. Call it what you want, but we are in America, people, and if you speak another language its hard to get your order right, right? At Genos, it was a little inconvenient to order and pay for our sandwich at one window and then move two windows down to order and pay for our fries at another window. I dont know if the same applies for drinks. 

First, the fries from Genos were excellent; we loved them. The provolone sandwich from Pat Kings was a little bland and not too exciting. The ""whiz"" sandwich from Genos was better. My husband is, but I am not a ""whiz"" kind of person. I did find  the ""whiz"" at least brought out the flavor of the meat and was a better, less dull experience. The meat from both places was about the same.  I wish it were more of a grilled meat with some crusty edges instead of a kind of water saturated been sitting in a warmer, waiting for the crowds flavor. The bread used from both restaurants was excellent. It stands up to the juice and maintains its form. The onions......the onions on both sandwiches left a little to be desired. They both seemed to be lightly sautéed chopped onions. If they had been grilled rings of onion and were just slightly caramelized they would have added so much flavor.  I get it about the tried and true recipes handed down from generations before, but come on, if its better, its better. Be a little more open-minded to improvement. 

Our opinion: 
Me: Meh, the cheese steak sandwich at Tubby's in Charlottesville, VA is so much better than anything we had in Philly, but if I had to choose, it's Genos steak, onion and whiz.
Dave: Johns- waterlogged in the seediest part of South Philly, we gave one of our sandwiches to a homeless guy downtown.  Pat's sandwich was good, but Geno's was a lot better with the whiz.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Soo take a guess as to where I got cheesesteaks when I was in philadelph recently. Yup, Pat's, Geno's and Tony Luke's.  Much like the Anchor Bar in buffalo is not the only place to get good wings, I'm sure there are countless other places in Philly to go for a good cheesesteaks.  But tourist is as tourist does. 

After having a perfect ""wiz wit"" at pat's, I tried geno's.  The taste was almost exact, but how in the he'll does anyone enjoy thier steak all flat like lunchmeat? Thumbs down for geno's!  We then went back to pat's the following day.  Being from the north, I kinds enjoy when the fast-pace of these places make the employees kinds rude. Ain't nothin personal. I also think a root-beer accompanies a cheesesteak pretty well. Pat's woulda gotten 5 stars from me, except that I work in a restaurant cooking up steak-hoagies all day, so I knew what to expect.

Pat's was fast.  The line was about the same, as it was at Geno's, but the fact that Pat's crew dumps about 1,000 pounds of steak onto a water/grease filled surface at a time had the line moving fast.

Whenever one of my friends even utters the word ""Pat's"" I usually just put my shoes on because we're going. We've gotten to the point where we'll just look at each other and say, ""You know where we SHOULD go...""

Winter, summer, spring, or fall - it is my understanding this place is open 24/7. No questions asked. There's usually a line at 3:00 a.m. and my brother bought one at 8:30 a.m. once on his way to a business meeting. Yummy any time of day. 

Geno's is across the street, and they apparently make a very similar steak, but I refuse to eat one. The line at Pat's is always longer, so that must mean it's better, right? We've dubbed Geno's ""The Circus"" due to their over zealous neon lights. It's ridiculous, actually.

There's a homeless guy who wonders around Pat's cleaning up and giving people napkins if they need them. He's awesome. We usually give him a couple bucks. Don't be nervous. He's polite and friendly.

The steaks:

Order a heart attack. It's Whiz, provolone and American cheeses. It's delicious. The rolls are on the softer side, and the cheese and grease will drip so exercise caution. 

My friend always orders a ""pizza pepper with"" that has hot peppers and pizza sauce. He loves it. They have a few specialty steaks like that one on the menu, but you should really go with something standard like a ""whiz with"" for your first time.

Steaks are like $6 or $7 these days. 

My brother decided he was going to eat five heart attacks in one sitting. It was December. I left after he put three down because I was freezing my ass off. (The seating is all outside.) He ate five, didn't swallow the last bite til he was going over the Ben Franklin Bridge. I don't think he returned for over one year.

The cheese fries are bangin'. Order EXTRA cheese fries and get the ""swimmers"" at the bottom using a fork. So much cheese. So much delicious.

After years of Coke products, they recently switched to Pepsi. I was sorta upset but I'm over it now. They still have a good variety of sodas to choose from. You can bring your own bottle of water or something. No big deal. Be discreet if you are drinking alcohol. I'm pretty sure it's illegal.

The meat is not cut at all, so its very lumpy and chewie. Often while you eat it large portions of the meat come out, leaving an uneven sandwich. What's more, the meat is EXTREMELY greasy. This sandwich has the most oil / grease than any of the competitors. To the point where it's just gross. You can't even hold it as a sandwich because fat drippings will slide down your arm; and if you go in the winter, that fat instantly solidifies. GROSS.

I'd finished what I was there for, hadn't eaten a thing yet, and figured I might as well try a cheesesteak. 

Of course I've heard of Pat's and Geno's, so that was where I gravitated towards. In retrospect, I should have just pulled over, got on Yelp and checked some of the many helpful cheesesteak lists...but no. My belly's impatience pretty much dictated when and where I'd be eating, and as I happened upon a parking spot across from Pat's, that was place.

I hit the bar across the street for some cash (was tempted to get more than just cash there, but was being responsible), strolled back and ordered two pepper cheesesteaks (one to bring home for the fam), handed over $20, and was promptly handed two sammys. Sat down to eat...

...and was not impressed. The roll was so-so, the steak & peppers weren't very flavorful (steak seemed to lack much seasoning at all), and the ""cheese"" was sorta gummy and sticking to my teeth. I'm going with two stars here, because ""Meh. I've experienced better.""...is pretty much spot on. And at $10 per, the value equation wasn't quite there for me. But hey, I did it...and I'll probably do Geno's at some point and probably have a very similar experience, and that's just fine and dandy. 

I will say this, however...my 10 year old daughter, who calls herself a carnitarian, certainly enjoyed hers last night after it came of the panini grill. I'm thinking I may have enjoyed mine a little more that way, too, crisping up that roll and giving it some crunch. As for the ""King of Steaks"" title, though...I'm thinking something along the lines of ""Esquire of Steaks"" may be a little more appropriate.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Gristly meat. Chewy bread. American cheese added almost as an afterthought (not melted on the meat, just kind of falling off, like cheese you buy at the grocery store that is close to its expiration date so it starts to get crumbly and falls apart). 

Maybe my boyfriend and I offended the delicate sensibilities of the staff by asking for a side of hot pepp--

""THEY'RE BACK THERE. YOUS CAN HELP YOURSELF.""

Well. Thanks. Gentlewoman.

I guess a whole hot pepper works, but how do I put this on my sandwich? Do I bite off little pieces and spit them onto my hoagie? Do I take a bite of the cheesesteak and then a bite of the pepper while my mouth is still full of meat gristle and stale bread? Or do I just throw it all out and go somewhere else to eat?

Turns out, the latter was the best option. 

Unfortunately, before we learned our lesson, we had to part ways with $20 for one cheesesteak, one soda, and the ATM fees for this cash-only place ($15 for the food, $5 for the exorbitant ATM fees not associated with this place).","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I came to Philly with, what I believe are, pretty realistic expectations regarding cheesesteaks.  Yes, I knew coming into it that Genos and Pats were tourist traps and that their might be better cheesesteaks elsewhere throughout Philadelphia.  But at the end of the day, after trying four different places, a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak and it didn't really live up to the hype at all.  With that said, and amongst the 4 places, I would have to rank these in the following order:

1) Jim's Steaks (3 stars):  Best place to sit and eat. They had the largest dining area with an upstairs area.  It was not air conditioned though.  As for the cheesesteaks, it was the best in terms of flavor, service, bread consistency. Bread wasn't too chewy or hard.I had it prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions) and mushrooms.  Better service than Geno's and Pats.

2)  Ishkabibbles (solid 2.5 stars, maybe 3):  Very comparable to Jim's but there's absolutely no where to sit with the exception of 6 barstools.   The gremlin drink is overrated too...but I had to try it.  I had it wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and mushrooms.  Better service than Geno's and Pats.

3)  Geno's (1.5 stars due to lack of smiles/service, but I'll round up to 2 for the hype and flourescent lights):  I like the bread but the meat was pretty flavorless.  Meat was in big slices and not chopped up.  I had it both with wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and prov/wit (provolone chesse and onions).  This was, by the way, the first place I tried.  They have outdoor seating so if it's cold, it's not the best place to eat there.  

4)  Pat's (solid 1.5 stars.  I won't round up to 2 since it's the least favorite of the four places):  The bread is softer and the meat definitely had more flavor than Geno's. The meat was chopped up.  BUT it was sooooo greasy that it gave me an upset stomach.  I had it with prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions).  They also have outdoor seating only.  

All in all, and if I'm in Philly again, I'm going to try Tony Luke's, Campos, Dalessandro's, and maybe a street vendor next time.  

BOTTOM LINE:  Skip the hype at Genos and Pats.  One of them may have started the cheesesteak craze, but the other establishments have made it better. It's time for Genos and Pats to catch up to the 21st century.

- Parking - you're in downtown South Philly, it's street parking, no parking meters (it's free), plan to drive around side streets for a while within 2 or 3 blocks, practice parallel parking, don't drive your Bentley (although I saw one)
- Before you get in line - Know the sandwich menu, know what sandwiches your party wants, and what options on each sandwich (drinks and fries are ordered at a separate window). Nobody, (Pat's or customers) will tolerate you deciding at the counter. 
- Order like a local - optional, but highly recommended... while I fully expected to fumble this one, I found that the instructions worked flawlessly which I found through a Google search ""how to order at pat's king of steaks""!
- Cash only - the prices are not low. Since you already know the menu, and know what you're getting (right?), have cash ready (at each window)
- Seating - it's all outdoors, under awnings, at picnic tables, right in the ambience of a busy city street, you might have to wait for a table to vacate 
- Appearance of food - let's just say, a paper wrapped cheese steak that was assembled in less than 5 seconds is, ummm, less than photogenic (see photo of my sandwich saying ""cheese!"")

They placed my steak on the counter: it was steak and cheese only. I stood there thinking it wasn't mine, but was told it was mine. The only thing they got right was the cheese. No onions, no pepper, no mushrooms. They were an upcharge btw. I notified the guy at the register (seemed to be owner/manager) and he told me that they were on there. I took the steak and fingered through  it. Nothing was  there. They finally added my toppings after bothering them enough. Terrible place. Overpriced ($11 total). Please don't go.

As I was in line at Pat's, my girlfriend was in line at Geno's across the street.  We both waited in line and met about the same time.  What I could not believe was that it was hot hot hot out, 95 degrees and sweltering.  For a Sunday at 2:30pm, I could not believe what I was actually waiting in line for, a sandwich.

When we both met back up, with both sandwiches, we did a taste test between the two.  I thought Geno's was better, slightly, I could barely tell the difference.  Truthfully, Geno's and Pat's tasted the same to me as an outsider from Denver, CO.  My girlfriend liked Pat's better.

Personally, I think the hype is much more popular than the food and everything has just blown up.  I've heard locals tell me that the bar between the two is better than both Pat's OR Geno's.

In any case, Pat's was by far the better of the two. The meat was more flavorful than Geno's and the bread was soft and delicious. The peppers that they had on the side were the perfect accompaniment for the sandwich.  Their fries were also pretty tasty. 
I also thought the workers seemed nicer than Geno's.  The Geno's workers just plain scared me.

- Have cash, they don't take credit or debit
- Be ready to spend at least $10 (Cheese Wiz without is $10 flat)
- Get the cheese wiz, I know it sounds gross but it's really delicious
- The steaks here are thinly shredded, unlike their competition across the street who serves a thicker cut of meat
- You can ask for your cheese steak to go, they'll wrap it up nicely

If you've made it this far, then you've probably already decided that you're going to do the touristy thing and see the lights. Well, at least you're here instead of across the street.

There are better steaks out there but if you want the experience to cross it off your bucket list, then by all means. I'd say you should go to Tony Luke's.

Now the real interesting part is that I could only squeeze in a stop to Pat's around 7am as we were headed out of town...so yes, I had a gigantic Philly cheesesteak at perhaps the most unusual hour ever. All thanks to the fact that Pat's is open 24/7!

Regardless, the sandwich - cheese wiz steak wid onions - was pretty tasty. I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of the bread, the quantity of the steak, the flavor of the cheese, and the balancing effect that the onions had in melding all of the sandwich components into one cohesive unit. Overall though, I must say that this famed combination of the cheese wiz and onion steak was just pretty good and not nearly as spectacular as some of the other reviewers have noted.

I've never had a cheesesteak in Philly elsewhere, but in Florida, yes.

We park the car, which oddly enough was the exact spot we parked in last time lol. There was no line so we were helped immediately. 
Friendly staff but truly over friendly. They were blatant with their flirting.

Food, we all ordered the same thing, some with cheese whiz and some with provolone. Last time, at Ginos, I had cheese whiz, not what I really like. I got provolone at Pats. We also ordered regular fries and cheese fries. I really liked the cheese fries, cooked perfectly and just pretty yummy lol I thought the cheesesteak was pretty good also but now I'm thinking maybe I do like the cheese whiz better lol
But really I can only compare or against Ginos. 
From what I recall, at Ginos, there were no options to add peppers and onions, etc. Maybe I'm wrong but I think I would've checked since I like that stuff lol. So I guess I would have to say that Pats is in fact, better.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Pat's HANDS DOWN!!! They're both terrific but I give Pat's the edge! Showing people iconic places in Philly? Yes, go here! There are better steaks but ya gotta bring people here for the great food and experience.

Wiz with and cheese fries and settle in for a while! GET THE CHEESE FRIES!!! It's a sliced steak, it is less packed with meat than I like but always does the trick.

Avoid after football games. It is the most popular steak spot in the city and is mobbed. 

The line moves and waits are around 20 minutes when it gets packed. 

Quick list of my favorite steak places
1. John's Roast Pork - packed with meat, chopped, american or sharp prove on a sesame seed roll. The roll sets it apart!
2. Steve's Prince of Steaks - same as pat's but with more meat, get the pepperoni steak! Not a true cheesesteak but you can't stop ordering once you get it. 
3. Pat's
4. Jim's
5. Delassandro's - (roxboro/manyunk small place. very worth the trip. Chopped so finely and blows across the street competition Chubby's out of the water

I must have done well because I was handed my sandwich moments after I put my change away.  

As far as the cheesesteak goes... I echo what most of the other detractors here have to say about it.  The Cheez Whiz is makes the sandwich... I tried isolating a bit without the Whiz and found it a bit dry and tough.  The bread isn't great but it was what I was expecting.  Comparing this to the cheesesteaks I've had in Seattle, I have to say this was better than our best but mostly because they used more Cheez Whiz.

I will preface this by saying that friends had told me that Jim's on South was all I needed, to forget Pat's/Geno's... so when I had Jim's a few months ago I was ... not totally in love with it. I got the classic steak, whiz and onions combo at Jim's. Perhaps it was the fact that I had it at 11am, but it felt super greasy to me. Previous cheesesteak experiences only included joints in Univ. City (Abner's, what up!) and they were fine by me. 

Now back to my Pat's trip. It was a cool 45 degrees as we set out for steaks. The wind was starting to pick up, but we were determined to get steaks, damnit, and eat them at the outdoor tables while staring disapprovingly at the garish neon lights of Geno's. Since my Jim's experience was the last steak I had had and it was super greasy w/whiz, I decided to go for my all-time favorite provolone on my steak wit onions. The meat was really nice, although I was a bit sad that the provolone wasn't melted on... and I think as a result it felt just a tad dry. I looked somewhat longingly at the superbly melty, gooey whiz on my friend's steak and at the moment concluded that in fact whiz was the right choice and I had neglected to go with it. Lesson learned for next time. I might not have fully appreciated my steak since the wind started picking up like crazy during our meal and felt like ice daggers on my hands as they held my quickly cooling steak. Despite the weather conditions though, it was a satisfying steak. Much less greasy than my memories of the Jim's steak I had. 

This place is cash only so prepare in advance. Lines for steaks and fries are separate so don't be a noob and ask the steak guy for fries, he'll just dismissively tell you go move left and go to the next window.

It pains me to say, but it's true. I remember going to Pat's during finals week in college back in 1999-2000. Sometimes we'd hit it two or three times a week. Steaks were about $6 back then. Despite the much lower price, the quality was a lot higher.

Nowadays, I'm paying $10 per cheesesteak and $5?!?! for fries. Top that off with a soda for $2.50 more, and alluvasudden I'm outta cash.

Review:

2 things define a steak...Bread & Steak.  Steak here is good but their bread is just ho hum, if not sort of bad...

Do not come here if:

You want a GREAT Philly Cheesesteak (Texans note, a Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie is a totally different entity w/ let, tom & on) 

You want polite service.

You hate scenes or lines.

Come Here For:

An iconically Philly tourist experience.  This locale is in South Philly, can be (was) dangerous about a block or two away and shares with Geno's a mini times square grid interruption.

You're drunk, you just got out of Delilah's and need a steak.  It's open 24/7.

Tips: 

It is not ""Un Philly"" to order anything other than Wiz With (I pronounce my ""H""'s damn it.  I also say ""you guys"".  I'm talking to yous).  Do whatever the hell you want, it's your sandwich.  Most Philadelphians (Suburbs Included) will go with American Cheese not Wiz.

Go here late night.  Geno's neon is a sight to be seen, there's just a good enough roughness to the crowd that makes it betterer.

Annoy the guy at the counter a little by saying ""I'll have a Cheesesteak w/ American Cheese"" instead of ""American Wit(h)"".  Add a ""please"" and a ""thank you"" in for good measure too.  If you're really white, say it in Spanish, you might get punched, but it'd be a f-in riot....If you're somewhat white I do not suggest the prior tactic.  You will not be served.  (Topical)


History:

Pat's deserves credit for creating the Steak Sandwich (Oddly it wasn't necessarily a cheesesteak) and that's about it.  You may have invented ""painting"" but that doesn't make you an artist, right?

Pat's made headlines recently for having a """"This Is AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING `SPEAK ENGLISH."" policy & sign.  Funny because America does NOT have an official language.  C'est Vrai!.  Ugh.  Funnier because this place is pretentious about their mastery of the english language while directly telling you to say ""Wit"".  It should say ""Wee bearly speak English hear, as eh rule, and appreciate yous kindlyness four being tolleranced."".  That alone made me pull a star off.  2 stars suckas.

We stopped off at Geno's first (http://www.yelp.com/biz/genos-steaks-philadelphia#hrid:_NrO8jJP-vCBEtuehOxWtA) and was sadly disappointed.  Was this famed rivalry, nothing but hype?

With dejected hearts we went to Pat's...and was rewarded with what we had been searching for!

Again, I had my cheesesteak ""wit"" (that means ""with onions""), with cheesewiz.  To keep our scoring model level, my coworker again orders the provolone.

Both were delicious!

My cheesewizy cheesesteak was nice and hot.  The bread was much softer then the bread at Gino's - although, it still didn't taste like the freshest bun I've ever eaten.  Unlike Geno's my coworker's cheese was completely melty, and both of our meats was nicely chopped.  And did I mention that Pat's also had a nice delicious sheen of grease on their sandwich?  Nothing disgusting, but let's face it, a good cheesesteak, no matter the type of cheese or the toppings, must - absolutely MUST - have a bit of fat to it.  The paper it's wrapped in, needs to be a little transparent, and while eating your cheesesteak, you need to feel like your arteries are getting a little cramped.

On this trip, we ate at 2 cheesesteak places.  Geno's (rated 3rd), Pat's (which we rated 2nd), and Jim's (see my review).  I have to say that this was definitely miles above Geno's - and I've been to both before, and knew that there was a reason why I stopped going to Geno's, and would frequent Pat's if I happened to be in the area.

A NOTE: because of the famed rivalry between Pat and Geno's, I find it really hard to write this review without doing a comparison.  Normally, I try to avoid comparing one against another, as each should stand on it's own.  However, the rivalry between these two is so popular, that it's nearly impossible to eat one without thinking of the other.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I paid tribute to this king on my recent trip to Philly. I must say I was nearly swayed by Geno's neon lights and almost headed over in the other direction. Fortunately my good senses kept me going towards Pat's and a right decision that was.... for I was told that Geno's serves its meat in slices, Pat's chops them up - for that I love Pat's.

So I did paid my dues and got in line... and managed to get to the window 30 mins after. My order comprised of a cheesesteak (cheez wiz wit onions).

My verdict: Pat's by a mile. They used more flavorful meat enclosed in a roll with a nice crust. However, I will add that that the meat used, while more flavorful than Geno's, seemed to be rather gristly and could be quite dry. Geno's seems to use more whiz on their variation and that whiz makes its presence known.

The three contenders were what I think are the most famous cheesesteak restaurants in Philadelphia, Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. 

I will start off by saying that I enjoyed the sandwiches at all three spots, very much. I ordered the cheesesteak the exact same way at each restaurant so it would be a fair comparison, with Wiz and no onion.  
I will rate the cheesesteaks on their own, on each restaurants individual Yelp page.

In my personal opinion, here is how they finished.

1. Geno's
2. Jim's
3. Pat's

Why did Pat's finish third?

With only three ingredients making up these sandwiches, there wasn't a lot to compare. 

The steak on the Pat's sandwich was chopped up into finer pieces than the steak on the Geno's sandwich. The taste of the steak was great; however I preferred the larger chunks of meat.  

The Wiz on the sandwich at Pat's was put on sloppily and wasn't evenly distributed.

The bread was pretty good, but wasn't nearly as good as the bread at Jim's.

I've never had any issues there, even as literally millions of hungry crowd members queue up demanding greasy, fatty, unhealthy beef and poured-on cheese products in a satisfyingly luscious bread roll.

Pats vs. Geno's!... 

well, here's the deal. I'll say this upfront, my idea of a cheese steak is different than any of these two. 

That said, these two locations are in a way iconic to Philly... does that hurt or help philly's cause for being a food mecca? .. well you have to judge for yourself, but my impression was that while the whole Cheese Wiz.. otherwise known as the (Wit!) cause that's how you gotta order it.. as there are directions, and if you dont follow said directions.. BAM.. back of the line... that's right.. back of the line and try again lol.. I thought that was kind of funny and a selling point for the show of it all.

onto the food... the steak itself to me was alright.. Pat's does it with Chopped steak with one kind of bread.. Geno's does it the other way with sliced steak on a more denser bread.. so it's the chopped Vs. Sliced battle. Personally, I like Chopped better, and I also prefer smaller onion chunks so a finer chop on the onion would have been alot better mixed into the meat to give it more flavor as well. 
 
The Breads are different as well, Pat's has a less dense bread while Geno's was much more dense but also more flavorful, so it came down to a personal choice, and this is for me.. I would have taken Pat's steak on Geno's Bread ... then it would have been something more to remember. Alone, and with all of the show boating, neither of these two places was highly impressive .. I give some of that due to Volume... they put out a LOT of meat and bread, onions and cheese.. and they do the system well.. but I think its Carnival Cheese steak to be honest, and I am NOT a snob when it comes to food, I just want to be honest about it. 

I can respect both places for their no nonsense, order it right or get out and try it again mentality.. I can also respect their ability to be fast.. but they rely on cheap product with minimal seasoning and overuse of the cheese to sabotage the meager steak taste.

I think that going to these places is still a good thing to do..

Mine literally took 5 seconds.

The sandwich was exactly how I expect a cheesesteak to be. I wasn't floored, but I was not disappointed either. The bread was very fresh and the meat and onions weren't bad, but it could have used more cheese. Maybe I should have ordered extra.

I also tried Geno's across the street. One of my friends ordered from there and we split both our sandwiches. I think any difference is negligible, and I would probably be indifferent to either one.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

It was an okay steak and cheese, but nothing special.  Basically this has more in common with a cheap steak'um.  I much prefer when the meat is chopped up and has a decent amount of ""real"" cheese. Roll was okay.  

It's probably worth it to go once just for the experience. We got one Geno's and one Pat's. Just to have done it.

I will say that the service was extremely speedy. Free hot cherry peppers was a nice touch.

I accomplished both missions. Visiting the bell had me learn a history lesson, going to Pat's taught me to never return.
sign 1: there's a long line but it moves very fast
my thought before: lines are a good sign because people must love the place
my thought after: the line is composed with majority of tourists and it moves fast because the people at the counter literally kicks you to the side
sign 2: the funny sign on the wall on how to order at Pat's
my thought before: funny = friendly? good sign.
my thought after: they DO MEAN what they post on the sign, it's not a joke... ""if you make a mistake, don't even TRY to change your mind when you are at the counter""
sign 3: two separate windows, 1 for cheesesteak and 1 more fries and drinks
my thought before: specialization! how smart! 
my thought after: the fries and drink window is the saving grace for this place. The fries are good and the guys at that window is a lot nicer.

So what made me dislike this place so much? I didn't mind the line, didn't mind the cold winter weather and didn't mind the seats.
At the counter
me:  one cheese steak with onion (instead of the term wits)
whoever inside: punches something and yells something to the back
me: and one mushroom cheese steak
whoever inside: gave me the WTF look and punch something in and yells something to the back again
me: and ...
whoever inside: 8 dollar
me: no, one cheesesteak AND one mushroom cheesesteak AND one roast pork
whoever inside: yells something to the back. "" $22.50""
me: hand over $40
whoever inside: look VERY annoyed. ""don't you have 50 cents?""
me: no
whoever inside: gave me the money
whoever else inside: hands me my stuff at the same time
both whoever that's inside: now F*** off
me: o_O!!!!! tries to grab all the stuff and money and run before they throw their spatula at me.

OK, i know that there's more of a chance to find good service in California, but I didn't except treatments like this.
Then I went on to get fries and drinks, that guy in there was nice, and he even smiled! 
So move on the the food, the steak is too thick and too chewy for my taste, and she didn't give me onion because I didn't say ""wit"", which is fine, I know it's my fault for not knowing that rule. The roasted pork tasted like wood? it's completely tasteless and drier than dry. Although the fries are good, actually, better than Geno's. and that's why I'm giving Pat's a 2 star instead of 1.
Knowing that they probably get a lot of their business from tourist, there's really no point to piss off someone who's clearly a first timer, because words do spread fast and are very powerful.

There are MUCH better places to get cheesesteaks in this city.  Pretty much anywhere else is better than either Pat's or Geno's.  Their reputation is entirely staked on their claim of originality.  I don't care if they were the first if they are not by any stretch of the imagination the best.  

The only circumstance I can forsee myself winding up in that horrific line at Pat's, underneath the garish neon crap that reeks of Vegas, is if I'm really drunk and it's too late to go anywhere else.

I order from Pat's and say whiz wit and within minutes I have a pipin hot cheese steak ready for consumption. I take a bite and the sandwich is solid. The meat is chopped nice and thin in comparison to Gino's and the whiz is the perfect ratio to meat to bread. Have to love nice solid proportions for sandwiches. The cheese fries are solid also so I do recommend this. This is clearly a tourist joint but as far as cheese steaks go I was not disappointed with this.

I didn't grow up in Philly, but I've lived in Passyunk square for a couple years; I've probably eaten hundreds of cheesesteaks and I'd consider myself an expert.

Pats is certainly not the best place in the city to get a cheesesteak, but for visitors, I feel like it is a necessity to go to Pats/Genos during the night and see the flashy lights and order a steak just like Ben Franklin did in 1750 (hmm, maybe it wasn't here that long).

Usually the only time I go down here is if all the other restaurants are closed, but I always go to Pats over Genos. Their cheesesteaks are better, the guys behind the counter are more witty and to me, it is more of an experience. 

The line is always long, but it moves excessively fast so don't curb to Genos due to the wait. Also, don't get intimidated by the wit whiz slang (There is a huge board on the wall telling you how to order), I just order what i want, cheesesteak whiz, mush, onions, pepps- all they care about is that you order fast and have your money ready.

What the heck is Whiz?

I recommend cheese whiz due to the fact that at Pats, they are not going to melt cheese on your sandwich they'll just throw it on, so bottom line, whiz is better here than american cheese (or provolone).

I mean, you need to have some sort of baseline to know what's good based on originality, freshness, and flavor.

When you order your cheesesteak, you'll get it right away at the same window. I, like many others, paid the cashier who yells out your order, then walked away only to hear the cashier calling you back in a few seconds to pick up your sandwich. I think it's our instinct to order and then wait a while to pick up our food at another window or something. Easy way to show you're not a local.

I guess ""wit"" means with onions, and ""wit-out"" means without onions. ""Wet"" means with cheese whiz. So if you want a Cheesesteak with cheese whiz and onions, you say ""wet cheesesteak wit."" That's cool--cheesesteak culture lingo.

So I went with a ""wet cheesesteak wit"" and it was pretty scrumptious. Easy to finish the juicy goodness and wash it down with a soda. There's something about eating a warm melty sandwich on one big piece of wax paper standing/sitting around a brick-and-mortar food stand. I'm thinking that's part of the authentic cheesesteak experience in Philly.

The roads are narrow and can be confusing if it's your first time driving here so just be careful for pedestrians and watch out for places you can park. There's actually lots of places to park close by--you just have to be mindful of the one-ways and such. You may get lucky and find a spot literally right next to the restaurant so take advantage of that if possible.

We first arrived at Pat's and after reading the directions to order, the bf walked up to the window and ordered: an extra cheese steak  W.I.T. (with onions) Provolone cheese ($8). It came out hot and wrapped in wax paper. I took a huge bite and...eh...I'm sorry...I don't see the hype in cheese steaks. I know you're supposed to order it with whiz, but the bf isn't too keen on that stuff.

The bread was a standard sandwich roll (wasn't toasted or anything) and inside were pieces of thinly cut beef, onions if you ordered it and the provolone cheese. It wasn't anything that special, but the establishment on the other hand was quite impressive with old school pictures everywhere. There's even a cement block on the floor that says Sylvester Stallone was at the exact spot when ""Rocky"" was filmed.

Across the street we couldn't help but be mesmerized by the bright lights of another popular cheese steak establishment.

My first stop was Geno's (the line was shorter).  I ordered the mushroom cheesesteak.  It was definitely something to brag about.  The bread was soft, not soggy and the meat was juicy.  I actually shared the sandwich with my nephew and after I finished my half, I was left wanting more.  The taste was that good.  I left thinking to myself, Pat's must be so much better.  The line was so long, how could it not be better.  The next day before returning back home, we stopped by Pat's.  The line was really short this time.  My husband placed our orders and then asked the gentlemen behind the counter to please cut the sandwiches in half.  He seemed very annoyed at the request and asked if we were taking it to go, which we were.  He then told us he couldn't cut it in half because the store policy did not allow them to do so.  My husband looked at him strange and then told him that we will stay and eat it if they can just cut the sandwiches in half since we want to share it with other people.  The man seemed very frustrated and told my husband to stop ""eyeballing"" him.  We were stunned and didn't expect such a remark.  He cut our sandwiches and refused to give us bags since ""we were eating it there"" He then told us to get our ""asses"" out of there and go back to New York where we came from.  After a few more words, we went back to the car to eat our sandwiches.  I must say it really wasn't worth the fight.  The meat was very dry and the bread was old.  In fact, I bought an extra sandwich to give to someone back home and decided it wasn't the best representation of a true Philly cheesesteak.  So, if you are debating about which place to try, Geno's or Pat's.  I would go for Geno's.  The service was better and the philly cheesesteak is definitely one you will dream about having again.

For the clueless: Both Pat's Prince of Steaks and Geno's Steaks next door claim to have invented the cheesesteak, and the verdict is really out as to what steak in Philadelphia is the best or first. Talk to any local, and you'll get as many answers as there are steak places. Think of that as a disclaimer: reviews of steaks here are highly subjective and heavily defended.

The actual sandwiches here are fairly standard taste-wise (Both Wit and Witout), but I find Pat's to be a little heavier on the meat, and I prefer the way the meat is sliced here to the place across the street......but at the end of the day you're still getting an overpriced steak sandwich after a long wait in line and fighting crowds of tourists.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Despite having the best cheesesteak in the city, it's just too much of a tourist trap for my liking. I pride myself on finding and supporting the holes-in-the-walls of the city and I generally find that the smaller places have better and cheaper food. This puts me in quite a quandary because the cheesesteaks are excellent, but the prices seem a little steep and the crowd that patronizes Pat's isn't exactly one that I care for too much. 

In my opinion, $7 for a cheesesteak, especially one that's on the smaller side, is a little pricy. I don't hold it against the place though. They know that they're a cash cow and they're milking it for all it's worth and they're making a killing.

The experience is what everyone apparently goes for, but I just don't see it. When I moved to the city a few years ago I did the touristy stuff and checked out Pat's for myself. Needless to say the two times that I've been there have been enough. You're supposed to order a certain way... and if you don't, the guy at the counter scowls and yells at you. The tourists eat it up and find it extremely entertaining. I, however, realize that it's as much tourist entertainment as it is genuine disdain for the people that he serves.

Overall, I'd say that Pat's is good for a one or two-time deal, but beyond that, there are many other great cheesesteak makers in the city that are more than worthy of your time and taste buds.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

So, when I go to Old Towne here in Geneva, and I order their very good philly, without onions and peppers, I get grief from the Chicago food snobs (ie my wife).  ""Then its not a real philly.  You don't know what you are doing.""

I ask her, ""have you ever been to Pat's in Philadelphia?""

""No""

""Well, I have,"" is my reply.  ""When you go to the home of the philly, Pat's in Philadelphia, you don't automatically get onions.  You get meat and cheese and you have to ASK for onions.  So there.""

Loved Pat's.   We went there in early April, and as we left the hotel I made the assumption that it was indoors, so I wore nothing but short sleeves... word to the wise, there is no indoor seating area.  Bring a coat in the cooler months or eat in your car.

One more funny story/heads up:  There are no restrooms either.  I had to piss like a racehorse when I was done eating.  I went to some oriental/sushi place and started to walk in and ask them if I could use their facilities.  Before I grabbed the door handle, I noticed a sign:

First night in town and yes, I have to have my very first authentic steak with.
I actually had my first steak and cheese at the city market. It paled in comparison. I was on a mission. I'd seen these legendary places in photos and videos. Pat's even makes an appearance in Rocky. I had to be there and taste it.

It was an awesome as steak and cheez whiz on a hoagie bun could be. The comparison is inevitable, so let's get to it.

The meat was more chopped at Pat's while Geno's left their steak more in tact. The flavor was pretty much the same, Geno's was a little more messy and juicy. I love messy and Juicy. I love lots of cheez, which Geno's delivered.

My pick? Pat's. It just edged out Geno's it had a bit more flavor and a bit more tender. But both were legendary. Geno's was more messy with oil and Cheese, which was amazingly perfect but I still had to go Pat's.

I see people put down these classics or call them tourists traps. Don't be a food snob. I saw and spoke to a number of locals there, not just tourists. What do you really expect from these landmarks? Shops like this are the product of a city's history and personality. I'm sure many locals take them for granted, as we in KC take ALL of are awesome BBQ for granted, but it's these special caveats of our great cities that color the rich tapestry of who we are in a specific region. They should not to be overlooked nor dismissed.

We got a funny looks asking to split our sandwich in thirds, but it was for taste testing purposes. See whichever sandwich tasted better (from our 1/3 sample size) we would then buy a full cheesesteak to ourselves from the best tasting spot w/out trying to fill our stomachs with two full samples from each. 

First thing I noticed right off the bat was the flavor from the meat! Better than the competition and my buddies agreed. Overall taste was close, but not as good. I think the bread separated the two. Pat's bread was thick and created dry spots for me.

I've eaten philly cheesesteaks in San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Orlando, and Phoenix.  I've eaten philly cheesesteaks in Mom and Pop restaurants as well as chain restaurants.  When I heard in November that my daughter's club volleyball team was playing a tournament in Philadelphia, I knew I had to eat a philly cheesesteak at the birthplace of philly cheesesteaks, which was Pat's King of Steaks.

My daughter and I touched down in Philadelphia at 10:30pm and after getting our rental car, we set out to find Pat's.  After driving through a working class neighborhood and very narrow streets, we were finally able to find a parking space close to 12am.  Parking and driving through the Passyunk neighborhood to walk to this philly cheesesteak mecca is stressful and a little tough.  Pat's doesn't have their own parking area.  You actually have to be lucky at that time of night to find a spot.  Fortunately for us, we had a very tiny Toyota Yaris rental car that can fit anywhere.  We were able to find parking really close to this cheesesteak mecca.  I call it a mecca because not only is there Pat's selling cheesesteaks, but just across the way is Geno's.  Both walk up and order restaurants are brightly lit with neon lights and there are throngs of people anxious to eat a good philly cheesesteak.  Even at midnight on a Thursday very early morning, there was a line of people waiting to order.  I don't know if it was such a good idea to bring my 16 year old, but this philly cheesesteak fanatic had to try the original cheesesteak.  My kid got exposed to the homeless, foul mouth patrons, and people smoking like chimneys.  I recommend you go to Pat's in the daytime or early evening.  Despite these things, the first thing I had to have when I got to Philly was a cheesesteak.

For the uninitiated, there is a way to order a cheesesteak.  Luckily, there's a sign that explains how.  There are two windows where you place your orders.  One window just for cheesesteaks and the other for fries, drinks, and anything but cheesesteaks.  Here's how you order:  Order steak wit (with onions) or without, choose what cheese, which I went with the original cheese wiz, but there are other cheese choices, and that's it.  I highly recommend the fries.  The original Pat's King of Steaks cheesesteak was just okay.  Don't get me wrong, I engulfed my large sandwich, but it wasn't spectacular.  The meat was dry and the bread was difficult to bite.  The cheese wiz with the meat was tasty, but I like real cheese with more tender meat.  Loved the crunchiness of the fries.  After you order your food, there are plenty of picnic benches to enjoy your meal.  As you eat, you can also gaze at the framed pictures of celebrities who have experienced the famous Pat's.

The 3 stars is for my actual experience eating a Pat's philly cheesesteak.  I've definitely had better and only chose Pat's because Pat's is the OG, the pioneer, the inventor of philly cheesesteaks.  If you're a philly cheesesteak fan, Pat's is a must visit because that's where it all started.  Next time, I'll try Geno's to see which is the better of the two philly cheesesteak giants.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

They are conveniently right access the street from one another.  We started at Pats.  They chop the steak they put on their sandwich.  Of course we got onions, and wiz basically we asked for the cheesesteak that made them famous.  It was good.  The roll was delightful and I was very happy with a tasty cheesesteak.  We then went across the street to Geno's.  Their meat is sliced not chopped.  We asked the same of Geno's, serve us the cheesesteak that made you famous.

So why do people come here and more importantly, why did I? Because ever since we heard of this thing called a ""cheesesteak"", we were told by friends and family, who themselves were duped into believing Pat's (and Geno's) was the place to go!

I saw a lot of people waiting on the fries line for steaks and getting rightfully angry when the people at the registers directed them to the other line. 

The sign right before the register gives you your options: steak with cheez whiz, provolone, etc, and with/without onions. I got cheez whiz and onions and it was AMAZING! For the cheese whiz phobes, it's not the fluffy cheese that comes out of a can. It tastes/looks like melted American cheese.

But I found their decor to be less tacky, more classy (as classy a cheesesteak joint can be).

Ordered a whiz wit (cheese whiz + fried onions), cost $9. I was kind of upset that a huge glob of whiz was on the paper and not in the sandwich bc that shit was hard to pick up with the bun. What a waste. I still tried earnestly to mop up the lonely cheese to no avail. 

I don't know what all the hate is about. I found my cheesesteak to be very enjoyable and sharing it was perfect. Eating the whole thing would have definitely been too much and not fun. It was my goal to have an authentic philly cheesesteak and obviously it isn't going to be a gourmet dining experience, but isn't that half the fun?

One other recommendation- if you're looking for an alternative to the classic cheesesteak, check out DiNik's Roast Pork in the Reading Terminal Market.

I'm a bit of a loyalist- it was at Pat's where I had my first ever authentic Philly cheesesteaks ten years ago, so that's where I've always gone and where I always bring any guests that are visiting from out of the area to Pat's. 

It's always a fun time to bring someone who's never had an authentic philly cheese steak to Pat's- the particular way in which you must order is charming and usually puts my guests in a nervous state of thinking, so I will order for them and amaze them with how easily I roll off 2-cheese-wit, 1 cheese wit-out, etc etc. I never have delved into the world of pizza cheesesteaks, or peppers or anything else. I like to stick to the simple things. 

And simple is what the sandwich is- chopped steak stuffed in a roll with cheese whiz and with onions, if you wish. The beef is never super greasy, and they top it off with the perfect smear of cheese whiz, so it's never oozing all over your hands and is the perfect, portable sandwich. 

There is a separate line for fries and drinks, so the best line of action is to send the newbies to get fries and drinks, and let the veterans order the steaks. Seats are always opening up, and you can always share with another couple.

How come no one tells you how crappy the neighborhood is going to be?  Maybe because you wouldn't waste your time venturing into South Philly for a mediocre cheesesteak.  It's nearly impossible to get ketchup onto your steak.  The dispenser is set up in such a poor way and they don't have any type of container to put it in.

This ""King of Steaks"" (aka, ""Don't eat a Misteak"") claims to be the original, and claims that the recipe was inspired by old Italian traditions. It's certainly in the right neighborhood and right crowd, so I believe it.

I went to Geno's first, and asked for a cheesesteak. This was my first mistake.

""Whatcha want on it, ya idiot?!?""

""Um, cheese?""

""Wit or wit-out?""

""With or without what?""

""Learn how to order, idiot! Next!""

Being new, I didn't know that the type of cheesesteak I wanted was called a ""wiz wit-out,"" but I made a big stink about being kicked to the back of the line. So I started swearing and calling anyone behind the counter within earshot any number of a hundred things one should never call another person. This prompted a number of hoodie-clad South Philly roughnecks to beat me within an inch of my life. They knocked out most of my teeth and broke both of my legs so that I couldn't walk over to Pat's and get a sympathy steak.

So I crawled.

""Wiz, wit-out,"" I mumbled through my mouth full of blood, and as the ambulance arrived, the kind folks at Pat's put a wrapped steak into my hands, curling my broken fingers around the bun, which they were kind enough to soften for me with extra cheese, as it was going to be nearly impossible to eat with 1 molar, 2 canine teeth and a single, half-broken bicuspid.

Three days later, I came out of my coma at the U of Penn hospital, and the nurse, who looked a great deal like adult film star Raylene if she was a man, brought me a wrapped cheesesteak that he'd been saving for me in the nurse's station's mini-fridge. And through the morphine, I have to admit that Pat's steak tasted really great! Maybe not something I'd expect from a ""king,"" but certainly prince-level. And I'm no dainty lass; prince-level is just fine for me.

So, who wins? Well, I'm terrified to go to Geno's, as I get horrendous pains in my skull that my doctors say are associated with severe PTSD issues, so Pat's has to be the one. In the great battle of the Philadelphia Cheesesteak War, Pat's King of Steaks is the winner...and not just by default. I might have died that night, but they still made sure I had a meal in my hands on the way to meet my maker. That, my friends, is what we call ""quality customer service.""

The cheese fries, I assume using the same whiz as Geno's but perhaps cut with some actual cheese, were even better. Apparently the late-night crowds agreed with us; the line traveled around the block and all the outdoor seating was taken.

Like Geno's- parking can be difficult, its an outdoor eating area, no restroom if you eat there, and 2 ordering windows. 1 for the cheesesteaks and another window for fries and drinks.

With that said, I usually order mushroom cheesesteak with wiz and onions. The meat is chopped up but not to the extent as Jim's steaks on South St. The mushroom Cheesesteak is good but not as good as Steve's Prince of Steaks. Pat's is a strong second though. Now complaints here. Will go here again.

Sure its a tourist trap. But how many places have a cheesesteak competitor across the street from them that are well known. Heck, if its your first time having a Philly Cheesesteak you can't go wrong coming here to try one then walk across the street and try the other company's cheesesteak.

The Ugly: Seeing the mountains of meat that they run through on a daily basis was almost nauseating. I felt like I was at a butcher shop! I think that they should hide the meat or not have so much of it in our view.

The Philly cheese steak was good but it's nothing that I can't get anywhere else or even from D'Angelos.

- Cheese is actually melted and plentiful
- Meat is in full slices
- Really tasty crispy fries

I had heard so much about Pats from friends and TV shows, that I figured this was our best bet. 

Located in South Philly, Pats is a little corner spot (and I do mean little), with several tables that wrap around the building. On a weekend, this place will be crammed. However, the line moves fairly fast, so don't leave discouraged. 

Two things you can expect at Pats; the most amazing cheesesteak you will ever have, and second; quite possibly some of the coldest service you will ever have.

Usually I'm a stickler for that sort of thing, but the steak was too damn good for me to care. You MUST follow the instructions on how to order prior to approaching the window, and have your money ready, because they will rush you along.

Christmas Eve day we are on our way to see some stuff in center city and decided to stop by here quickly so my niece and sister can try a Philly cheese steak. 

Big mistake.

We walk up to a shop staffed with at least 5 or 6 people, no line whatsoever and order two steaks with provolone and peppers and onions. They come out within about a minute after ordering with about 3 or 4 peppers on each sandwich and the cheese hasn't even begun to melt. 

I could see throwing sandwiches out with that kind of who gives a crap sort of haste when you have a line 20 deep, but we were literally the only people there at the time, so this just stunned me. Especially when I just plunked down $19. 

I decide to not say anything because I figure tourist trap places like this are used to turning out crappy sandwiches and this is what I get for letting them lure me in. 

But then I decide I want a drink, so I pay $2 to get a soda, and ask the guy at the counter to also give me a cup of water please. 

I get told that they only have bottles. I say I don't want a bottle (not at $2 at least), tap is fine. One of the guys repeats that they only have bottles, even as I'm staring at a stack of small cups that are clearly meant for tap water. 

Finally, after mentioning that I just spent more than twenty dollars with them and I think they can spare one cup for the purpose, one of the dudes relents and gets me a tiny cup of water. 

I guess Pat's figures everybody they serve is a one-time customer, which is what their terrible sandwich and even more terrible service made me. Too bad they didn't consider that I live about 4 blocks away from them and host a lot of travelers that ask me where they should go to eat. 

I know where I'm going to tell them to avoid from now on and send them to Steaks on South or Jim's where at least the cheese on their sandwich comes melted and they don't have to beg to get a friggin cup of water.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The bread could have been warmer, the meat could have been more tender, and there could have been more cheese, and even more melted at that.  Adding onions into the mix just made the sandwich oilier...but I do have to give it to them on their fries.

First off I heard that this was the place to go to for a historical meal. Being the originators of the Cheesesteak I was dead set in coming here for years. My surprise however was to see limited seating, and a line crowding along a narrow street sometimes feeling like I was going to get run over by a car. Not the best of first experiences. After a half an hour wait I got to the line and of course trying to act like I was a regular ordered a Whiz Wit. (Steak with cheese whiz and onions) What came after was shocking as the guy making the food made a mistake, just to have the cashier curse telling him to just throw the food at me and that he doesn't give a f***. Now after hearing this I was quite pissed, I wanted to curse him out for such a rude comment, but after realizing that people were behind me waiting and this was after all South Philly I decided to let it go. I got my drink and fries and it was back to the car to grub.

Now onto the food. I've heard so many arguments on which steak is better. Geno's or Pat's and I have come to one conclusion. Pat's takes the hat. There's something about the original thing that got me thinking about chopped steak and the perfect bite. The only thing was was wrong about the cheesesteak was the lame stale bread it was put on. It felt like a mission just to take a bite of this amazing cheesesteak. The cheese fries were fresh and crispy with the right amount of cheese whiz and to be honest I really liked Pat's more. If they had better service and a cashier who actually had an education I would have rated this place higher for sure.

1) like to be treated like sh*t. 
2) don't care for meat quality
3) want a stomach ache.

I came here with my family, We ordered about 6 hoagies. They have a huge pile of meat that is cooked and just waiting to be slapped on bread. We got some with whiz some with american. The whiz is kept hot, so if you are getting a cheesesteak with whiz, you'll get a hot gooey cheese steak.  My american was cold. They literally slapped a piece of  american cheese on bread and then the meat that was sitting in the pile. The cheese didn't melt..how could it..the meat was cold..

I didn't expect an GREAT meal, but I did expect a warm one. I went back and told the guy behind the counter that the steak was cold and he looked at me with a facial impression like ""its my fault"". He told me that I ordered the hoagie 10 minutes ago, which was a lie ..and that is why it was cold. I proceeded to tell him I just wanted it hot and he told me NO. At this point I was confused, and looked at the long line and asked him if he was refusing to give me a hot cheesesteak in front of all his customers..and he told me ""i'm not going to give you another cheese steak, here's your money back""

I had the pleasure of taking an impromptu trip to Philadelphia from Baltimore at 2 in the morning and unfortunately Pat's and Geno's were the only places that were open at 3:30 when we arrived. 

I can honestly say that due to the fact that I grew up on the other side of the city it wasn't until I was an adult that I ever ate at Pats' or Geno's.

But I digress, I decided to be fair and I got a steak from both Pat's and Geno's and I will attest that I liked the steak from Geno's better. But, that is my opinion. Is this the best in the City though? NOT AT ALL by far. Do yourself a favor and look up Pagano's get yourself a real cheesesteak.

There are a few signs on how to order your steak which is cool because it gives you an opportunity to feel like a Philly native when you order. It is a cash only establishment as a heads up but there is an ATM across the street. The cheese steak was $10. I ordered one with provolone and onions. The first window handles strictly cheese steak orders and the second is where you can order the rest. They keep the peppers, ketchup and other condiments in an outdoor area. 
The cheese steak was very disappointing and the fries were good. First they forgot to put the onions on and then they forgot to season the meat. The steak was dry, very similar to steakums with none off that delicious fat that flavors good cuts of steak. The steak lacked seasoning, salt, pepper which left me to season mine with ketchup, mustard and peppers. The cheese was very minimal and the bread was cold. The only good part about the meal was the fries. Maybe as the line grows the quality of the cheese steaks goes down but I was highly disappointed in the overall quality of the cheese steak I had. The hot dogs they offer aren't very good and are also served on a cold bun. 
The service was expedient. As I said before, my opinion is take a picture/selfie but save your money for a better cheese steak from Ishkabibble which I've heard is much better.

For me this was one of those bucket list things I wanted to do and also follow the steps of millions before me. I made a special trip to Pat's as I was heading back to DC. 

I arrived around 12 PM on a Easter Sunday (This morning) and found the parking right in front. There were no lines so I was excited. The young guy at the window looked and sounded like a Philly punk. I don't believe customer service is their thing or maybe they stopped customer service since 1930 as well. Not so sure.

I ordered the original cheese steak and before I could say fries and a drink, the sandwich somehow magically appeared and I was asked to pay $9 bucks. I said, what about fries and drink? and the guy almost killed me with his eyes and loudly said, ""Next window ""SIR""!""  It must be nice to make your customers feel stupid.

So I went to the next window and met with other genius who was just as happy as the first dude. This ""gentleman"" had the same attitude but a bit less intensity. An order of fries and drink will cost you another $6. 

So I got my cheesesteak and took my first bite. I waited for something magical and what I felt was chewy bread and unchewable steak! You have been serving this since 1930??? I really hope not. Maybe they have cut a deal with a local dentist. Maybe there is a statistic somewhere that talks about ""TMJs and Cheesesteaks in Philly""... We need to call the local news channel to look into this further.

The meat was hard to chew and the bread was chewy. I think the cook woke up on the opposite side of the bed.

The steaks are bland really. The service is RUDE which I suspect is supposed to be part of the attraction.   (Why snarl at people standing well out of the line just reading the menu????!   Really???

Something about the bread rolls in Philly, I don't know what they put in it, but it's delish. Pat's bread is definitely better than Geno's -- it has a slight crunch when you bite into it, so awesome. 

And the meat! Almost brisket style meat, very tender and juicy. Doesn't carry tons of flavor, but that's what the cheese, onions, peppers, and relish are for right? Didn't get the famous cheese wiz, and opted for provolone, and it was still yummy! Added a little ketchup and chili sauce (which btw is real damn spicy) and it was a good clean sandwich.

Pat's is located in a single lane, tightly knit, blue-collar neighborhood. The steak is chopped (my preference), but dry and lacking much flavor. In fact, that sums up the sandwich nicely: dry and lacking flavor. To Pat's credit, in contrast to their competitor, they provide access to napkins and a sloppy assortment of condiments. The do have a large number of sandwich options to choose from and the staff was easy-going and friendly, creating a friendly environment, opposite of the ""other guy"".

Both restaurants had the same amount of people in line but I chose to go to Pat's because it was closer to where we parked. 

Some tips:

1 - make sure you follow the instructions before you order.  Are you ordering a cheese steak ""wit"" or ""wit-out"" ?  They're referring to Cheese Whiz and don't try to enunciate the word ""with"" - say it as it is spelled on the sign or they may send you to the back of the line.  Or they may squirt your face ""wit"" -- haha, they're really nice and I don't think they would do that. 

2 - order the fries and devour them

3 - the peppers are spicy! yum!

4 - no indoor seating - just picnic tables outside (Geno's only has outdoor seating, too).  So if you're from CA like me, make sure you dress well on a late winter evening because our skin is not thick enough to handle the Philly winter.

I had my picture on the ceiling next to Marilyn Monroe before they remodeled the place (working on getting back up there).  Pat's is a great experience.  You can't rate this place on food alone, as it is so much more than that.  On the food side, it ranges from good to awesome, depending on the quality of the meat that gets tossed into your particular roll.  The flavors are always great, but the meat varies, and that can make your food experience less than stellar.  In the old days toppings were very limited, but now there are more choices than just whiz and onions.  There's something to be said for the classic ""cheese with"", but my more modern ""pepper provolone pizza with a bushel"" is my current fave.  However it is topped, the roll will make you drool, and the meat will either send you to the moon or looking for a toothpick.  
     It has been fun to watch Pat's change over the last 30 years.  Old lines were long, but today's late night lines can exceed one hour.  Good thing I'm treated like family and never wait.  Also good is the fact that as long as you're not dying of hunger, the line can be the best part of the trip.  Therein lies the magic of Pat's, and that is the ambience.  This place draws the best and the brightest, and the worst and the dumbest (and drunkest).  I've had a cougar stick her cheese whiz coated tongue in my ear.  I've seen a police car chase a suspect around the triangular block the wrong way.  I've had a friend threatened by a guy wielding one of those giant mustard pump bottles.  I've eaten a steak for breakfast at 9 AM.  Rare is the visit to Pat's that is not accompanied by a special memory.  After all is said and done, life is about compiling pleasant memories, and I have a ton from Pat's.
     These days Pat's is on TV a lot, and has developed quite an out of town following.  Neighbor Geno's is often featured along side for some reason, and I want to say something about that.  Pat's is the original, and Geno's is a wanna be.  I have eaten close to 500 Pat's steaks.  I have never eaten a Geno's and never will.  I have no reason to.  Even if the sandwich is better, which I doubt, Geno's isn't Pat's.  Pat's is iconic, like Spago or Tavern on the Green.  It is one of a kind, and the kind of place you can brag to your friends about visiting.  You just can't get that cache at Geno's or any other steak place.

We didn't know whether to choose Pat's or Geno's when we walked up, and both places were almost equally busy.  Maybe it was just my aversion to the way too bright lights of Geno's that made me want Pat's, but I was happy with the choice!

We ordered a Mushroom Cheesesteak wit, with both whiz and provolone.  

Now, my first cheesesteak ever - and just before this, that night - would have looked so sadly impotent next to this fat baby that they handed us.  It was HUGE.  And LOADED.  And HOT.

We were too full to eat it while it was hot, so next time I'm back, that's what I'll do.  But even eating it later, I realized this was much better than the previous one I'd had.  The portions were obviously crazy generous, the meat was way more flavorful, and though the mushrooms & onions blended in with the whiz & meat & provolone so you couldn't really taste them, it was good.  The bread was all gooey cheesy meat juicy, in a very good way!

So given my new found knowledge, I also proceed to order a ""provolone steak wit"" and he gives me a chuckle and yells ""PROVO STEAK WIT"". Two sandwiches are wrapped and shoved out the window in record time.

Totally part of the experience.

Upon unwrapping my sandwich, the original looked tantalizing despite it's use of cheese whiz. You could see it hugging ever crevice of chopped steak and onions.

I ate at Pat's back in the mid 1990s and early 2000s and the quality of the sandwich was far superior to the slop they're pumping out now. Nowadays, they're not even toasting their bread and are just taking steak meat off the grill, slapping it on the bun, throwing some over-sauteed and burnt peppers/onions on top of it and drenching it in cheese whiz. Gross. 

I have had cheese steaks from street vendors in Philly that destroy anything that Pat's is shoveling out of their window. At least the street vendors take pride in what they're making and don't treat their product like some assembly line sandwich that they could give two craps if it tastes good or not. 

And I'll say another thing - the customer service is appalling. Rude, cocky, and disinterested are three adjectives I would use to describe the hired help at Pat's. Truth be told, Pat's is a typical iconic establishment that has long since passed it's relevant prime and is living off both its name and its history. If they keep treating customers like they do, Pat's won't have to worry about whether they're better than Geno's.

It could have been because my boyfriend and I were hungry, but I preferred this over Geno's. The bread was toasted making the overall sandwich much better tasting. However, you can add ketchup, mustard, relish, and hot peppers if you desire (all toppings are DIY and free).

With its rival (Gino's) located across the street, it's hard to rule out which of the two are better. Nonetheless, we've decided to try Pat's where visitors, tourists and locals assemble in a line (that wrapped around the block) to await for the glorious moment of biting into an original Philadelphia Cheesesteak. 

A few things to remember -- there are STRICT guidelines on how to order at Pat's:
Step 1 - State if you want steak or onions on your cheesesteak: ""wit"" or ""wit-out"". 
Step 2 - choose your cheese: Plain, American, Provolone, Cheese Steak, ""wit wiz"" (cheez wiz) or ""wit-out"" (no cheez).
Step 3 - Have your money ready (IN YOUR HAND, not in your purse or pockets).
Step 4 - If you mess up any of the above steps, ""you can wait and try it again when you return from the back of the line"". 
Note - There are two windows; the first is where you order your cheesesteak and the second is where you order the other things for your cheesesteak -- like fries and soda. 

FOOD - ""One Cheesesteak wit American wit onions"". Our steak was a bit tough, chewy and bland as if it had been sitting on the grill for quite some time before being served instead of that greasy, moist and tender steak we've heard so much about. We were a bit disappointed with the outcome since we've travelled from NYC for this, but I guess that's what happens when you're trying to serve 20 customers per minute throughout the day. 

We'll try again another time, but I wouldn't come back anytime soon. However, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying Pat's if they've never had it before. It's something that you still MUST TRY when you're around the area and who knows - maybe you'll get a really moist, juicy and tender cheesesteak.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Bob, who was right behind me wasn't so lucky. He froze indecisively for few seconds when he was asked to order. He then blurted out ""what cheese do you guys have again?""

#1 - Sonny's: soft bread, delicious cheese and flavorful meat. Our absolute fave. Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect.

#2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier.

#3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent.

#4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice. 

#5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip.

Hopefully our little taste testing endeavor will help anyone visiting Philly for a brief time, looking to try the best cheesesteaks this city has to offer.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

You get a lot of meat and it comes with cheese.  For the price, the sandwich is MUCH smaller than any other cheese steak joint in Philadelphia.  You will find that the steak floats in a pool of grease within the roll.  Never have I eaten a cheesesteak where I could basically tilt the sandwich and watch a steady stream of clear grease splatter on the street.

If you're getting any type of cheese other than Whiz, they don't even bother to melt the cheese on the steak.

Of course, if you're a tourist go here to say you've been.  And if you're from the area and have never been, it is a nice stroll through the Italian Market to reach Pat's.

That's what a co-worker and I hoped to resolve when we made the quickest pit stop ever en route to catching our train out of the city.  Pat's.  Geno's.  Quite simply, a LOT of beef, cheese whiz, and bread to put down--all in 20 minutes.  (Luckily, there were no lines this Thursday evening.)

First was Pat's.  $8.25 for a cheesesteak with whiz, no onions/pepeprs/etc.  Soft, yet crisp, fresh bread--nice.  Pleasantly surprised at how well the whiz worked.  But the meat, served in rough chunks, was a little tough and not that flavorful.  Good, but onto Geno's...

Geno's.  I was wary of this place's reputation for in-your-face politics.  The ""Take Back Our Country"" signs were a little eyebrow-raising, but beyond that, nothing crazy.  Plus, this steak was damn good.  The meat here was neatly sliced, properly cooked, and well seasoned.  My co-worker raved about the hot sauce he loaded onto his.

Before I start, I want to mention that I'm from Arizona, and before coming to Philly, I have never had a cheesesteak before in my life. I'm not a huge fan of steak/roast beef/red meat sandwiches, so essentially I never really got around to trying an authentic cheesesteak (and being from Phoenix, a mediocre one at that). But I decided, When in Rome, and saved my first ever cheesesteak experiences for my first ever trip to Philly. 

Me being me, I had to try a steak from both Pat's and Geno's to compare. From all the people I survey, the favor between Pat's and Geno's is a pretty stark 50/50. So how could I try one without the other? Answer: I can't. Our first steak was from Geno's, and it was pretty good. However, I enjoyed the steak from Pat's significantly more. 

Two things about our steak from Pat's that stood out: the steak itself and the Wiz. The steak is cut differently at both places, and I'm assuming seasoned differently too. Pat's steaks seemed much heartier, with a more genuine and robust flavor than that of their neighbor. I also appreciated how the Wiz was served piping hot, and how we were given three generous lathers of Wiz on top of our delicious steak meat (this was more Wiz than what we got across the street, and seemed to be a better/appropriate steak to Wiz ratio). 

As every reviewer posts it is cash only, and expect to pay around $10 per person for a steak, drink and cheese fries/fries. Additionally, don't expect stellar service from the staff either. They get you in and they get you out. Other than that, you're not gonna get much more. But in an odd way, I liked the brief and short interaction with employees; a reflection of that rough around the edges Philly/East Coast charm that I was so unaccustomed to.

I'm sure there are much better cheesesteaks around, but for my first cheesesteak experience, I have to say I am impressed.

Pat's-

I really wanted to like your steaks- no- I wanted to LOVE your steaks.

As someone who grew up in the Philadelphia metro area eating delicious gooey cheesesteaks from the likes of Real Pizza in Wayne, etc., I've been traveling the world for the last 13 years proselytizing our city's primary culinary export, bitching about airport restaurants that claim to offer ""Philadelphia Cheesesteaks,"" and spreading the word about Amoroso's rolls to all who would listen.  I had never been to Pat's Steaks and, honestly, I thought I was just saving the best for last.

In San Francisco, I got my wife hooked on the Cheese Steak Shop on Divisidero, so when we got to Philly, we were both primed and ready to dive into Pat's (Geno's is not and will not be an option for us given their English-speaking only stance for their customers.  Call it racism or xenophobia, I call it just plain sad and mean-spirited, especially since they're adjacent to a Mexican food restaurant.  Aren't business owners supposed to be inclusive as a profit-maximizing strategy?  Anyway, back to the review).

So we fight our way down the sidewalk past the neon abomination known as Geno's and see Pat's looking as Philly as Philly can be.  We order at the steak window (no chicken cheesesteaks for the wife, it would seem), then head over to the soda and fries window (annoying rigmarole) to get birch beer (why hasn't this PA treat made it out of the state???).

I was so hungry I horked my steak down, but completely without relish.
In my mind, one of the things that makes a great cheesesteak is that all of the ingredients are jumbled up together because the chef has taken the time to chop it all together on the grill.  At Pat's, they take the roll, layer on the cheese (provolone, in my case), then put on the meat and finally top it off with grilled onions.

Separate but equal?  I think not.

The roll was huge, the steak ended up being pretty dry (since it wasn't slathered in gooey cheese), and the whole concoction just sort of slid, slowly, down my gullet like a fat, dry-meat watermelon.  Where was the flavor?

Sad.

Pat's.  We could have been so good together, but you're just not for me.  I'm leaving you for Jim's on South Street who, if I remember correctly, knows how to do gooey cheesesteaky goodness.

Wit or wit-out?  This is the language you need to understand before you go to Pat's.  This means onions and whiz if you don't know.  Now, people will tell you that Whiz is the way to go and if it is your first time, you gotta try it with the Whiz.  Just to do it once.

So here is the deal - after you specify your onion preference (why would you get it wit-out?) and your cheese preference (you can also get Provolone, American or a Pizza Steak), then you need your cash.  These guys don't take plastic.  And the first window will only take your steak order, so if you want a drink and/or fries, you need to slide down to your left and order those separately.  But these guys move FAST.

I ordered a mushroom and pepper steak wit (onions and whiz).  I got a Dr. Pepper and no fries.  It was 9:30pm and I had just flown in from Atlanta and my traveling companion texted me when we landed and said ""where are we going for cheesesteaks?""  So obviously, I Yelped it.

The cheesesteak is really big, but OH so good.  They shove a plastic fork in the top for you and you will probably need it.  We enjoyed our steaks as we ate al fresco (your only choice) and drank our sodas.  The steak was thicker cut then expected and a little on the tough side (not cut properly), so as much as I loved the experience and the flavor, the meat quality left a lot to be desired.  Based on the beef and how it was cut, I had to knock this to 3 stars.

Pat's and Geno's were right across from each other. So here is my take. 

Parking is non-existent at either locations. Seating is located outdoors and around the stores. There are lines at both stores too. So I was confused. Which one do I choose. So I did what most people seem to be doing. Get one from each!

Pat's lines move fast. These guys know what they are doing. You go up to the register and place your sandwich order and pick it up within a minute. No joke!  I ordered 3 subs and got them in under a minute. You pay cash. Then you move down the line and order your drink and fries. You pay cash here too. 

I ordered a mushroom cheesesteak with onions. My hubby ordered a plain cheesesteak with cheese wiz. The steak was sliced thinly. They give a lot. The sub was well seasoned, juicy and disappeared in record time. Their fries were crispy. 

Geno's cheesesteak was good too. The difference we noticed - steak was sliced a little thicker, about the same quantity of steak, less seasoning (not salty), and very little cheese (it was smeared onto one side of the bun).  It was delicious but a bit drier than Pat's. 

All in all it was a great taste comparison. We were stuffed!  Depending on your preference there is a sandwich for you on either side of the street. 

Geno's had an awesome DJ playing music to keep the folks lined up entertained. You can hear it loud and clear from Pat's. :-)

Being from out of town, I wanted to experience each place so my wife and I purchased one ""wit whiz, wit"" from each place.  You will find Geno's review on their site.

Pat's was by far the more flavorful.  It actually had some spices working to flavor the meat.  The meat was tender and the onions were cooked.  Whiz is Whiz.  Not one of the best sandwiches I have had, in fact, we have Big John's Steak at home, a local chain, and their sandwich is far superior to either of these ""Philly steaks"".  

Both of these establishments are in a really bad part of town.  The parking is difficult.  We were able to park a block away and walk.  The smells, how shall I describe it......we parked in front of a storefront that was raising chickens.  The smell was overwhelming and it was chicken crap.  There is garbage everywhere.  Someone needs to tell these Philadelphians that they need to put their garbage in a can, not on the street or sidewalk.  So much litter and garbage it was hard to walk on the sidewalk.  

I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Go to Reading terminal market and find a good place to eat if you want a Philly cheese steak.  At least you have a place to sit and dessert is just steps away.  

Have to give it 2 stars because I have to give Geno's at least one star.  I really think this is a 1 star place.

The only parking spot we ended up finding was closest to Pat's. We had the original intention of trying both Pat's and Geno's, but because the lines weren't stretching to Rittenhouse Square we decided to try one at a time. Now, this might have been a mistake, because by the time we got to Geno's we had already eaten one steak.

Anyways, disregarding all the errors we made in trying to achieve a fair taste test. we decided to try Pat's first, onions wit. Although, when I ordered I definitely got it wrong because I said 'onions with cheese whiz'. They didn't seem to care though and slapped together all seven heavens, the earth, sun, and the moon in about 7 seconds.

Wow. All I can say is wow. The cheese whiz complimented the steak extremely well, and though I was a little exhausted by the end of the sandwich, I can still say that every bite of it was bold, intense, and filled with flavor. I really prefer the way they do their steak because its so much easier to eat and it seems to let the fat and juice of the beef explode in your mouth. Not only this, but it seems like you get more food for the price compared to the neighbors. In addition, the onions were perfectly sautéed and so the whole sandwich was like a well-executed blueprint. This pile of grease, meat, cheese, and bread was enough to give us ""the Itis"" and put us to sleep.

With the consent of my significant other, we both agree that between Pat's and his neighbor, Pat's has our patronage.

- Wit provolone philly cheesesteak ($10): less bread to meat ratio, so you're gonna end up eating a soggy cheesesteak if you don't eat it right away. I saw a couple teenagers pouring a bunch of juice from there cheesesteak on the ground. Meat seemed to have more flavor than at Geno's. It's chopped up and very tender. Onions by themselves were tasty too. Peppers here were super spicy and took me surprised on the forst bite, but I liked Geno's better where they weren't are as spicy.

For the quality and amount of food you get, definitely not worth the $10. Your cheesesteak is wrapped in a single, flimsy deli meat paper. I really liked the wrapping paper at Geno's. More sturdy. Fries looked old/refried multiple times.

The history and atmosphere here is great too. There is no indoor seating but there are a few picnic style benches outside.

For a proper cheese steak, you are much better off going to Pastificio's or, even better, Steaks N Shakes, where the prices are very reasonable without cutting back on quality of ingredients....AND the parking situation is far better at Steaks N Shakes.

The one and only that's been around for 70 years and always has line-ups no matter when I pass by. It's located right across from Geno's and from what the story tells they've been competing forever.

Sadly, like the cola wars, it's a war of form over function. They taste exactly the same, with the same exact flat chewy rubbery tasteless bread; same greasy meat boiled tasting meat. The fries taste exactly the same. It's the same restaurant but without the culturally insulting signs. So the verdict is the same.

The line wasn't too bad when we got there and moved quickly. I like how they have an ""guide to order"" your cheese steak. I tried one with no onions and Provolone cheese. It's a bit confusing since the first window is just for the sandwich and the second window is if you want a drink or fries... 

And of course it's CASH ONLY so bring $! There are some condiments on the side and there are some SPICY peppers! I like spicy and those definitely did the trick.

In short, this place is your typical tourist trap. For those who have never had a cheesesteak before, of course you will fall in love.

You shouldn't come here during the day when you have better options, or if you're in the mood for a delicious cheesesteak.  The bread is cold and sometimes too hard, (too long out? or day old?)

After walking from the car, we decided, let's go with Pat's and if we're still hungry later, we'll go to Geno's.  I think Pat's was an excellent decision on our part.

That and the hell I would catch from everyone, because the first question anybody would ask is how were the philly cheesesteaks!?!?!  

Anyways,  so there are two places that are must trys, Geno's and well of course Pat's.  They've been featured on TV, and the locals all have an opinion about which is the best.  Conveniently, they are across the street from each other, so instead of making the hard decision to try one or the other, try both.  

Geno's and Pat's are the complete opposites on the outside.  Geno's looking super flashy with lights and vibrant colors, where as Pat's seems a little more hole in the wall.

However, being the ""newbie"" that I am, I was scolded by one of the Pat's employees for showing my Geno's sub, while ordering my Pat's one.  So beware.  Also!!! the correct way of ordering is dependent on the type of cheese you order and if you want onions or not.  ie.  the classic would be ""Whiz"" aka. cheese whiz, and if you want onions, ""with,""  I got a ""Whiz with"" at both places.

Immediately, it was obvious that Pat's looked more substantial and well more appetizing.  While, both were very similar, I believe Pat's took the cake with this one.  Pat's seemed to have more steak and better bread, and the ""whiz"" seemed to taste better and more substantial.  I also order a side of fries, which were better than most fast food fries, but nothing to write home about either.

All and all, if you're in Philly, might as well try the best, even if you don't enjoy it.  You will probably experience food coma afterwards, since to be honest they are a pretty hefty/heavy meal.

Not many tables.  When we got there at the end of the lunch rush all the tables were taken and many customers were simply standing and chowing down.  While waiting in line we scoped a couple of guys leaving and swooped on their table.  

Be ready to order, simple single words are best.  For what I got, whiz and onions.  Only order the sandwich at the first window.  The second window is for drinks fries / everything else.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Let me give you an example, if someone uses old oil when frying, the oil will taste bitter and gross and will give you a stomach ache later.  If the oil is only used sparingly, such as enough for a couple of batches of frying then it will be sweet and hold the flavors of the meats.  Pat's really held the flavors in the meats and the oil soaked bun full of rich greasy goodness and cheesy euphoria sent my senses reeling.

So, once we landed I started to research for the best place in town on the internet and by asking the locals. 

The 2 front runners were Geno's and Pat's King of Steaks. Now, I was familiar with Geno's becasue fo the Boys to Men videos from the mid 90's, but I had never heard of Pat's. So I did what any smart tourist would do, I asked a cab driver and a valet. Both said Pat's was the best, so my mind was made up; I'm going to Pat's.

After using my trusty GPS, we parked and got to our destination. As soon as I got out of the car, I was amazed to find that Pat's and Geno's were down the street from eachother. As we got closer, the line reminded me of In N Out back home, just faster. 

With this being my first time to have an authentic cheesesteak, I took a minute to assess the situation. I noticed the sign on the wall educating tourist and outsiders about the proper procedure on ordering.

The resulting diced meat was bland and dry and it got its only flavor from the cheese.  The bread was fresh and soft, so that's a plus.  The menu has a few more options at Pat's, but the cheesesteak as main event was average, but unimpressive.  I was expecting juicier and more flavorful steak.

I went to Philly Just for the Damn Cheesesteaks and I had Both Pat's and Geno's to compare the two..




To me Pat's wins, by a very small margin.. #1 because it seems to be the more Authentic one, and #2 because of how the steak is chopped...... 

My favorite cheesesteak would have to be Pat's cheesesteak with wiz cheese and grilled onions. The flavors simply blend together very well..

Geno's tastes almost identical, but it seems like just a carbon copy of Pat's to me.. But I will write a review for geno's and give them 5 stars as well.. because they taste just as good.. I just dont like the way the meat is sliced.

For me the quintessential cheesesteak would be a Cheesesteak from Pat's with Both Wiz and White American cheese, with grilled onions.. I have yet to try an authentic Pat's or genos cheesesteak with provolone , mushrooms and bell peppers.. I think It will not be as good as  a plain old cheesesteak with wiz..

First of all, the service is awful.  The people who work here typically make a gimmick out of how nasty they can be to their paying customers.  It's not surprising that the national image of Philadelphia is so poor when you get treated like a jerk for no reason because Pat's staff thinks that you should have the privilege to pay for their product.

Second of all, the service wouldn't factor as much if their product was consistent, but it isn't.  Don't be surprised if one of the following happens: your roll is stale, the meat is gristly, or they got the order wrong.  I wouldn't bother to tell them about it though since you'll probably just wind up getting more frustrated.

Lastly - and in fitting with the theme that they don't take pride in their business - is the state of their location.  I'm not sure if there could be a more stark contrast between Pat's and Geno's.  On one side of the street, you have Pat's, where it looks like they haven't even taken the time to powerwash the place since when the first Rocky was filmed.  On the other side of the street is Geno's where they impeccably maintain not one, but two street corners.

In summary, this review is not a recommendation to avoid going to Pat's as much as it is a warning.  Go to Pat's once or very infrequently to get the experience.  I wouldn't recommend becoming a regular here though.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

There may be some locals reviewing Pats and giving it low stars- but I have to disagree- if there are better cheesesteaks in Philly, thats great; but for how long have they been in operation? Are they open at 3am? Most likely you will find some fantastic steaks in Philly- but Pats for me takes the, um steak- they are the ORIGINAL, in business for 82 YEARS (as of 2012), the quality is top notch, and the outdoor seating and stainless steel counter and building exteriors bring you back to another era.

Tips for Ordering at Pat's:

The line at Pat's King of Steaks moves quickly, so it's best to be prepared -- know what you want, and how to order it by the time you get to the front of the line!

Step 1
Specify if you want your steak with (wit) or without (wit-out) onions

Step 2
Specify Plain, Cheez Whiz, Provolone, American or Pizza Steak

Step 3
Have your money ready. We are cash only.

Step 4
Order your just your steak at the first window. The second window is for fries and drinks.

Step 5

As for the food, the cheesesteaks are OK. I've definitely had better, so Pat's is really overrated (saying this from a Philly native POV). I love how they made the prices come out even as well. As for the fries, it's great with the cheese. Pat's is also a great place to get some late night food as well, after a night from the bars/clubs. Therefore, it does get packed at night so watch when you go.

Service is barely there, since all you do is order from a window. They aren't always nice, as well. Price is a little tad experience; I think it's because of its so-called popularity. It is cash only as well. There are many tables surrounding it for seating, but they might be all full if there's a crowd.

As for its rivalry with Geno's, I say the main difference is how they prepare the steak part of the cheesesteak. Pat's is the traditional (in my sense) cut up into pieces/minced, and Geno's are thin, round slices. Geno's also hype themselves greatly with tons of pictures of famous celebrities, while Pat's is more humble. I've always gone to Pat's since I was a kid, so I can't really say more for Geno's.


Recommendation: If you would like a cheesesteak that can kind of sum up the Philly Cheesesteak Experience, I'd definitely try Jim's on South Street.

After braving that debacle it was time to tear into what I felt was one of the better cheese steaks I have consumed to date. I actually know for a fact this will kill any hopes of finding a great local cheese steak which at least means I know what one should taste like and should look like for that matter!

For starters, the portion size of the cheese steak alone is definitely surprising as it was pretty big and filling as well. The bread was soft and easy on the teeth, but just the right hint of crisp to still provide a crunch. As for the steak it was tender and partnered with the grilled onions just blew my mind. Finally the piece de resistance, CHEEZ FREAKIN' WIZ! That was not skimped out on and it was literally everywhere as shown in my photo, but hey that sent the whole thing into a state of euphoria

In all fairness I wasn't able to get to Geno's, but I have to pace myself for Philly or I'd never go back.

Again you can't complain when you have melting cheese, with moist beef and grilled onions. The beef at Pat's is chopped up and oily, so it is nice and moist and makes a nice mess of the wrapper. The onions however are minced small than Geno's and they have an unattractive dark yellow hue to them where it looks like they were overcooked in fat/oil.

If your trying to get good cheesesteak, go to Jim's on 4th and South Street Or Max's steaks. A lot of colleagues talk about this spot, and I figured I give it a try and taste for myself.

Their customer service is quick and they really don't care about their customer.  They just want you to get in and out as quickly as possible so that they can service the next person (even if they don't have a line).  

The cheesesteaks arrive speedy-quick (as in I ordered and within 10 seconds, she was pushing it through the order window to me).

I took a day trip with my friends from Virginia just to take the Pat's-Geno's challenge and it was well worth it. Pat's was ooey gooey whizzy goodness. The meat was juicy and the bread was perfect. Geno's Steaks didn't even stand a chance in my eyes. I had some pretty high cheesesteak standards after eating at Jim's steaks before this, and Pat's was just too good. 

I must say that I was really intimidated to order because of all the horror stories I heard of people being sent to the back of the line because they didn't know how to order properly. After being coached by a local, and practicing for a good five minutes, I swallowed my fear and took the front stage to the ordering counter. I'd like to say that I looked like a pro and that made me really happy! If you like the spice, order hot peppers on the side!

The reason we found Pat's to be better than Geno's was because the bread here seemed more fresh and the steak was better seasoned. We also enjoyed the fact that it was cut up unlike the steak at Geno's.

In the end the staff here was polite unlike Geno's. The sandwiches tasted way better and the overall experience here was comfortable unlike the interaction at Geno's. 

The final true reason why this restaurant was better was because it wasn't filled with anti immigration propaganda like Geno's.

First clue no long line today. Second clue sandwich was immediately ready. Not at all impressed with the sandwich.

Pat's or Geno's?

Well I can't actually remember why we chose Pat's over Geno's but it was good decision regardless.

One of my friends even told me that if you have a cheesesteak in hand from the other restaurant, they won't serve you! Be warned though - this place claims to be the inventor of cheesesteaks and has plenty of tourists taking pictures of the signs.

So let's talk about this place. First of all - IT'S CASH ONLY! While the line might seen overwhelming, they have it down to a science, and can get you in and out very fast. Once you get your cheesesteak you can go to the condiment bar and get things like ketchup, relish, and peppers. We got their pork cheesesteak, which was delicious. The meat was tender, the cheese was subtle and had a good tempering taste, and the bread was warm and soft.  With the condiment bar, you essentially have a choose-your-own-adventure when it comes to food. We got some peppers and relish, which were good suuplements, but I suspect we might have had an even more delicious meal if we added ketchup or mustard. 

A good way to go about this is to go with a friend, where one of you guys go to Geno's and another goes to Pat's.

But that also might blind you a little to all its shortcomings. I grew up stopping at Pat's before Phillies games, so its hard for me to separate the nostalgia from the reality. But I try.

Let's start with the obvious - the cheesesteaks suck. I think we all can mostly agree on this. if you actually like them, you need to experience Steve's or Chinks or Delassandros or Tony Luke's or hell, even Jim's does it way better. And for insult to injury, its a tourist trap so they charge you 8 bucks a steak. And the whole soup-nazi thing, please. It might be funny as an urban legend, but when i see tourists get sent to the back of the line because they took too long to order, I cringe for our collective image. Shitty food and shitty service is about as great a combo as swiss on a cheesesteak.

There are things to like about Pats though. The scene is a good one. I like the South Philly vibe, the outdoor seating, the baseball diamond and bball courts across the way. Its a bustling little city corner that is fun for any fans of people watching. They have really good birch beer. I don't know why I think this, I'm sure it's nothing special, but god damn that fountain birch beer is delicious!

But here's the one thing that you need to know about Pats. Pats is all about the CHEESE FRIES! They have the best cheese fries (of the whiz-and-fries-only category, not fanciness with bacon or ranch or 3 cheeses) in the whole city. I swear by this. Plus, they are priced more reasonably (3.50 is still a lot, but way better deal than the steak). There also is never a line at the fry window, so you don't have to wait, and they are soooooo good. My fiancee insists that they taste so good because they are fried twice. I respond with ""you can fry things twice??"" These fries are fat kid tasty, yamsayin? Seriously, do yourself a favor, next time you go to Pat's just bypass the steaks, get some fries, and soak in the vibe.

And it was a question that I was happy to tackle while I was in Philly. Pat's is a no nonsense restaurant where you better not waste the cashiers time when you get to the window flip-flopping on what to order. They even have a sign for non-Philadelphians on how to order a proper cheesesteak so you really have no reason to be slow (and you better have cash or you ain't getting nothin'). I got a steak wit whiz and onions and in no time at all it was in my hands ready to be devoured. And devoured it was with much enjoyment. The fine chopped steak smothered in melted cheese whiz and onions on an Italian loaf put anything outside of Philly to shame. Now was it better than Geno's? Well, I have to take a Switzerland approach to this question since I preferred Pat's meat but Geno's cheese whiz was superior. So I guess I'll just have to get one steak from each the next time I'm in town. A Philadelphia institution that showcases the uncut, no BS spirit of South Philly. So if your feels are easily hurt or you like to be pampered and fawned over at restaurants, go elsewhere.

There was no one in line when I got there at noon so I didn't feel as weird ordering because there was no pressure (after you read their ordering sign you'll understand what I'm talking about). I asked for the cheesesteak WIT (onions) with provolone, but I had to go to a separate window to order my drink. They were super fast because by the time I ordered my water they handed me my sandwich.

There is plenty of seating outside and as many napkins as you want; trust me you are going to need a bunch. My first bite sent a line of grease running down my arm which proceeded to drip onto my pants... Whoops! The meat was pretty tasty, the onions were awesome and the provolone cheese was good. There was too much bread in my opinion, and for some reason I felt like I wanted some mustard or sauce on top but that's not how you do it in philly so I went without.

If you get provolone, it won't be melted at either restaurant so stop complaining.  If you watch how they make the sandwich the provolone never goes on the grill so obviously it ain't gonna melt.  But you should get whiz anyway.  

Honestly the meat at Pat's isn't great.  Dry, less flavor, and fatty compared to Geno's, and even though you do get more meat here, I'll take the tenderness and flavor of Geno's.

I believe there is no rivalry. In fact, they're probably family and use the rivalry to boost sales at each location. Anyhow, as far as the food goes, Pat's is better. Their bread is better and their meat is not as dry at Geno's. Pat's French fries are also hands down better. Overall it was a cool experience.

After much research, I decided that we had to go to Pat's first because Pat's WAS the first - the place where the cheesesteak was invented. 

CHEESESTEAK: Bread was authentic white, Italian (fresh-tasting, despite being midnight, not too tough or chewy) and the meat was quality, thick shavings, with bits of fat to keep it juicy. Chopped onions were delicious because they were cooked in the beef fat and the provolone was nice and sharp. It was a fine, decent sandwich - especially if you just flew 6 hours across the U.S. and you're starving. There were only two problems with it: my sandwich was warm (not hot) and because it was served warm, my cheese never melted. I prefer ooey-gooey, cheesy cheesesteak sandwiches, not steak sandwiches with slices of cold cheese. 

ATMOSPHERE: Outdoor seating only, you can't get lettuce and tomatoes with your cheesesteak, and the place is overrun with disgusting drunks BUT it's open 24-hours, so if you don't want to dine with the late-night crowd, don't go late at night!

Like I said in my Geno's review...If you're stuck on that corner deciding whether to jump on the line for Pat's or Geno's, Pat's is definitely better. I'm not saying by a landslide or anything but its definitely clear. WHY?

1. The meat is chopped up like it should be
2. It's pretty tasty

My Dislikes:
1. it's kinda not warm. Yea the meat is, but the over cheesesteak isn't warm. It still bothers me to think why any establishment would do such a thing considering that warm food has to served over a certain temperature.
2. When they hand you the cheesesteak, HOLD it parallel to your body. I was holding to at the time in between my fingers like a couple of cans of soda and the flippin meat juice dripped all over my jeans and dryclean only sweater =(

Honestly, I've been told for decades that the cheese steak grinders that I've been enjoying from the Greek pizzerias in Boston paled in comparison to Philly, and that Pats and/or Geno's are the gold standard. Finally this past Friday I got to put Pat's to the test and I must say, with no doubt in my heart, that I was very underwhelmed. Basically what I got was hot, thick steak (which was actually good quality, but I prefer it a lot thinner) with no flavor (i.e. too lean), slapped on top of cold American cheese (don't judge - I'm a New Englander, whiz is a sacrilege) and topped with cold slimy onions. The whole sandwich making process took about 2 seconds, so the steak was all bunched up in the south end of the roll, the cheese never melted fully and in many places was still cold, the onions all fell in one pile in the middle of the steak, and the whole thing was leaking grease and water (perspiration? from what?) like a runny faucet.

What could I have paid for this delight, you ask? $8.50! And no kiss good night, or an 'i'll call you some time' as I braved the daylight in my wrinkled dress to go find a cab home. A 16oz soda cup filled three quarters full was $2.00, and tasted like some sort of low-grade Sysco wanna-be-pepsi syrup mix instead of the authentic Pepsi they were advertising. Basically, highway robbery and tourist abuse.

I'm so sorry Philly. Maybe most of you are already aware that Pats is not very good, and that the staff are dismissive and rude, and that the whole experience is kind of an insult for the money they charge for a sandwich I could best (and have) with something out of a Brooklyn 24 hour bodega. But just in case you aren't aware of all this Philadelphia, I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you.

Rumor has it that the cheese steak joints in Old Towne are much better, but I cannot testify.

Yes, as a resident of Philadelphia for 4 years during my undergraduate days, I enjoyed sharing stories about the greatness of the cheesesteak (sans cheese for me, because of the intolerance... and because cheese is just plain nasty), and hyping up Philadelphia and everything about Philly (I love Philly).  So of course Pat's (and it's evil competitor, Geno's) would typically come up as a topic of conversation.  

It's pretty incredible, after being removed from Philadelphia for the past 7 years, how much notoriety this place (and its counterpart across the road) has with people all around the US.  Kinda a shame that such fame causes people to come here, in droves, and essentially be the representative cheesesteak experience for plenty of people in the US/world.  

It's not a bad cheesesteak by any stretch (albeit, a criminally overpriced one).  And that nasty Philly attitude you gotta order with, I suppose it makes it part of the overall appeal... but my mindset is, you have to be nice to your customers (mind you, there's barely any rudeness here, especially when compared to Geno's... racist pieces of trash).  

All in all, you can find a viable cheesesteak here, you'll just have to pay with cash (no cards accepted)... and you'll most certainly be overpaying for a devastatingly simple sandwich that you can get for an infinitely cheaper price elsewhere (and likely a better sandwich, overall, to boot).

This is the best cheese steak I've ever eaten in my life (to be fair, I haven't had many).  Bread was soft and meat was perfectly cooked.  I love the peppers topping you could add yourself from a vendor outside, my favorite was the roasted pepper olives.  My eyes were bulging and I was sweating like crazy from eating those hot peppers, but it was very tasty. 

This was a good place to sit down, eat your sandwich and have great conversation with your companions.  I had an extremely good time here.

if you've never been to a food stand (yeah, i'm going to call it that instead of a restaurant, and if you go here, you'll see why) like this, be prepared with your order and money ahead of time, cuz they don't appreciate waiting, questions, or special requests. that being said, that makes them super efficient. our sandwiches were out in less than a minute.
now, prices. 2 standard cheesesteaks is $19. our fries and 2 drinks were $9 i believe. a little on the pricey side, but then again, with all the tourists flocking here, they can afford to charge a little more, understandably. but be prepared, they're cash only as well.
you go to pat's for the food, and the food alone. not the atmosphere (a few outside tables, covered from the rain but certainly not the wind), the prices (not outrageous, but still probably three times what it actually costs them to make the food), or the people (sometimes i wonder if they actually all just hate their job). but let me tell you, if you're looking for a real philly cheesesteak in the heart of philly, pat's is where you want to go!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Their cheesesteaks are nothing spectacular, but they are good. I'm sure you can find a better cheesesteak out there, especially in Philly, but this is the original, and perhaps a cheesesteak is only supposed to taste as simple as this. It's a couple of simple ingredients put together, and it works. You learn to appreciate it, just as you would appreciate a good grilled cheese. It's not something I would want to eat too often, but I do like it every once in while.

**Favorites**  Wit. Whiz. Eat with pickled cherry peppers. Cheese fries.

**Recommend?** I would bring out-of-towners here if they're interested in trying the ""original"" Philly cheesesteak. I prefer it over Geno's.

The more cheesesteaks I eat from here, the more I like this stuff.  When I had my first Pat's cheesesteak many, many years ago when I was a little girl, I wasn't impressed.  At all. I thought, ""This is the sandwich Philly is famous for?"" That was when I didn't know how to appreciate the flavor of Cheese Whiz.

Yes, my friend, the main flavor of this famous cheesesteak is from the Cheese Whiz.  Melded together with the fatty juices of the thinly sliced beef, it provides the perfect complement for the otherwise bland meat. If they happen to skimp on the Whiz (which happens sometimes!) then the cheesesteak suffers in flavor. The bread is nothing special, IMO, but it's an Amoroso roll. In fact, it can get really soggy after the sandwich sits for a while, but it stays chewy! The soft bread allows the flavorful cheese and juices to soak into the bread and you get this soft chewy goodness enrapturing the pile of meat. Unless you can't stand onions, definitely get it ""wit onions.""  The finely chopped onions add a nice subtlety to the flavor profile. Go get some pickled peppers if you like spicy.  Eat them all together and it becomes the perfect cheesy meaty goodness slathered inside a bread roll.

Cheese fries are good, if you eat them fresh.  Otherwise, the cheese and fries themselves can get chewy and/or soggy.  The regular fries are only ok.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The seating is outdoors here under the overhang, and there's ketchup, mustard, pickles (hot peppers too) and napkins outside.

Tables a bit messier than expected, though, I think they just hose them down at the end of the day.

The food here is excellent! The service was also great. I ordered fries and basic cheese steak. The food carried just the right amount of cheese - not too overwhelming, nor was it not enough. 

I guess part of the reason why they want you to know HOW to order is because your food is given to you literally by the time you can even get your cash ready to pay. Make sure to have cash as they do not accept credit or debit cards. Not too sure if they offer any promotional or discounted rates for military, etc.

Top it up with sweet peppers, a little bit of spicy relish, and use liberal amounts of ketchup.  I also recommend baby wipes so you're keeping your fingers clean after - that grease has a way of persevering over most napkins.

Subject: Pat's Steaks
12 August 2000 03:13:36

In Wildwood [New Jersey] I had my very first Philly Cheese Steak ($5) in that part of the world. Because I told the order taker of my virginal status, he helped me construct it to my liking and it sure was. Yummy!

At the Steel Pier in Atlantic City I had a $6.25 Chicken Cheese Steak that wasn't worth half the price.

After a hot and humid evening of sweat-soaked dancing with the Philadelphia Swing Dance Society at the un-air-conditioned Commodore Barry Club, I went to Pat's Steaks to have a genuine, authentic, original and only real honest-t'-goodness Philly Cheese Steak. Even though the bars wouldn't close for another hour or so, the line was very long. I got in it behind a bunch of big guys who had the look of Hell's Angels but the sound and demeanor of Mafiosi.

When I told the lie that I was going to have my very first Philly Cheese Steak, those choir boys excitedly and agitatedly tried to give me the accurate information I needed to successfully negotiate the hazards of ordering. They were rapturous about what I was about to discover, they about to enjoy, and told stories about making special, very long, trips to Pat's for the real thing. ""Want onions? Say `Wit'. That's all. Don't say nuttin' else. Give 'em yer money and move outta d'way. Don't hesitate. If you do, y're outta dere.""

When my time came at the small window, I confidently said ""Wit. And an order of 'fries"". They coulda died. With all they had tried to do for and with me, I failed, they had failed. ""No, no! Y'order the 'fries over there at the next window"" which I did, along with an orange juice.

I joined them at a small sidewalk table and lied about the sandwich. It was not nearly as good as the one I had had in Wildwood. In fact, it was no better than the rather sad chicken version I had earlier at the Steel Pier.

Pat's cheesesteaks were awesome. The meat was made fresh and the cheese was yummy. The cheese fries were just as good. I am so glad we listened to the cab driver. We walked over to Geno's afterward to see what the hype was about and the cheesesteaks did not look comparable to Pat's at all. The only negative thing I can say is that there is no restroom.

For starters, I learned that ordering a cheesesteak in Philly (or at least, at Pat's) requires its own language, specific syntax and all.

As an example, to obtain a cheesesteak with Cheez Whiz (really, is there any other type?) topped with onions, one would walk up to the window and state ""Steak, Whiz, With.""  That's it.  Pay up, your sandwich, if that's even the appropriate term, will arrive at the next window over within a moment.  They don't mess around back there.

For those looking for something a little more formulaic, it's...

[Sandwich Type], [Cheese/Faux-Cheese Selection], [With/without Onions]

-------

All that said, I didn't have any cheesesteak on this excursion.  Just their fries.  Which, considering their pricing at $2.50 and the quantity, don't seem to be much of a deal.  Particularly given the lack of overhead, since it's only outdoor seating.

On the other hand, they were amazingly satisfying fries.  Ultra-crisp on the outside, nicely salted, and starchtastic on the inside.  Just the way I like them.  Mmm.  Fried fantasticness.

Let's clear some things up.  Pat's is the originator of the cheesesteak.  They don't require flashing lights or degrading slogans to sell cheesesteaks.  Their legacy and food sell themselves.  Also, as a local university student I would lead freshman groups down to this location to experience the original steak.  This isn't where many of them would eat steaks after that night, but they had to experience it once.

The way to go here is American or Provolone wit.  Cheese whiz is a novelty that I don't understand, but am guilty of having enjoyed for many years.

But go to Dindics in the Reading terminal and get a pulled pork sandwich if you really want something delicious.

The cheese steak I ordered ended up costing a total of about $10.50 or something for an 8 in. Whaaaaaat?! So pricey, not worth that much at all....at all... I got provolone on my steak, it wasn't even melted, literally just placed on the bun. 
The roll was ok, a little dry, not warm or toasted or anything.

Pat's Steaks are horrible. I forget the exact price but its somewhere around 10 bucks. Cheap bread. Hard, big pieces of ""steak"" and cheese whiz out of the can. Gross. 

Also, side note: both Pat and Geno's are a negative impact on the south philly community. They let their measly one or two garbages over fill, and then cheese steak wrappers blow all over the area. This may not sound like a big deal, but imagine that happening 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And besides that, its a tourist attraction. So people come from all over to get this horrid steaks. They eat. They drink their sodas. And then they have to take a whiz before getting back in their cars. One problem. There are no bathrooms. So tourists pee on street corners. In the garden nearby. 

Please don't support this negative impact of a tourist attraction on the neighborhood of south philly.

Pretty darn good, hearty cheesesteak eatery, one of the two famed rivals corner to corner from each other.   Of course being from out of town I had to do back-to-back taste tests of the finest cheesesteaks Phiily has to offer, judging for myself which one really IS the best in town.  

I found Pat's barely a hair better than Geno's caddy-corner to it, though it does not mean this place has faults that the other can make up for.  The Pat's green peppers, mushroom cheesesteak consists of a hearty mix of chopped steak, TONS of Cheez-Whiz, sauteed mushrooms, green peppers and onions all crammed into some bread that barely held it all together.  While the flavors were hearty, I found the amount of Cheez-Wiz overwhelmingly obnoxious as it oversalted-overcheesed the flavor of the cheesesteak and dripped off the sandwich onto puddles on my wrapper.  They added just the right amount of cheese for their cheese fries, though the fries had better flavor and overall better than what they offer at Geno's.  

When it comes down to it, I like the bread texture and the options of mushrooms and green peppers at Pat's but overall flavor is masked by the cheese as opposed to at Geno's.  The cheese fries are hands-down better here than Genos.  Maybe I have to come back into town and try the Provolone cheese steak for better judgment.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

So, if you ask a white person in Philly to name the best place to get a cheesesteak, they will probably say Pat's, Geno's or somewhere on South Street.  All of these places will ask you questions such as, ""Wit or witout [cheeze wiz]"".  

I've never been to Geno's (too racist), but I've done Pat's and several similar incarnations along South Street, including a vegan steak at Govinda's and they have all been absolutely terrible.  As a newbie to Philly I choked down the flavorless meat (or ""meat"") and wondered what all the hype was about.

Then I met some black people.

If you ask a black person in Philly to name the best place for a cheesesteak, the response will likely be Max's--particularly the one at Broad and Erie.  It's in the hood.  The guy making them has one visible tooth.  A homeless person will probably ask you for change on the way in.  The Philadelphia Tourist Bureau is not coming around to take pictures.  

But the steaks?  Oh man, the steaks are amazing.   Flavorful sizzling meats, perfect fried peppers and onions, fresh bread seared on the grill and a cramped line filled with shit-talkin'' Philadelphians?  This is a real Philly experience.

If you go early you'll probably be able to get a cheesesteak without waiting in too long of a line. If you go around 1-3am there is usually a line wrapped around the building. There is no indoor seating so you will have to eat outside so be prepared for that if it's cold out. 

One of the nice things about Pat's is that the time that you order your cheese steak, pay for it, and get it is about 15 seconds so don't be discouraged if you see a long line. The people working there have zero patience so definitely know what you're ordering before you get to the window. It's best to stick with just a cheesesteak with wiz and or onions. After you get your cheese steak you can go to another line for drinks and fries, their cheese fries are covered in cheese wiz too and they are incredible. 

The cheesesteak itself is pretty good. They are about 10 inches and have thicker cut meat with cheese wiz slathered all over it. It looks like a lot of food but it goes down quick. Waiter service comes in the form of homeless people, who without asking will take your trash and give you some napkins to clean the mess of cheese off your face.

Despite the crowd most people took it to go and seating was available. Other condiments like ketchup are directly behind you after you place your order. 

The sandwich was pretty good and was reasonably priced, but as I have not had any experience with the competition I believe a 3.5 is a reasonable rating. While it was good, I have had some here in NY that I found to be comparable.

I have to say that hands down, pat's Philly cheesesteaks are a cut above geno's. The beef is more flavorful, the roll is softer, and the selection if cheeses and other toppings is much better.

I would recommend splitting one unless you don't mind feeling awful after eating your meals. These sandwiches are heavy, salty, and best enjoyed with a side of cheese fries. They are also best enjoyed while borderline blacked-out drunk, which is about the only time I am ever able to rationalize spending $10 on one of these things. At certain moments of certain nights though, I'd probably give these things 5 stars.

Most people are aware that there is a native Phialdelphia etiquette to be observed while ordering cheesesteaks. So read other reviews or talk to your Philly friends before ordering. A friend of mine was legitimately turned away from here for being too wordy with his order.

I've seen them both on the Food Network as rivals and they're literally across the street from one another.  I decided to try Pat's first because many of the locals had the better ratings for them. Okay, so about the taste, I ordered the mushroom, onion and pepper steak ""wit"" (that means with cheese). They have three choices of cheese (provolone, American and whiz), I got the cheese whiz. So the big difference I heard from locals is that Pat's chop their meat as opposed to Geno's. The steak in combination with the veggies were extremely flavorful and delicious bursting with good seasoning and the cheese whiz is the best on top. Now, I will say, the bread was not all that great and that's probably because I'm use to Leidenheimer's French bread in New Orleans. The bread had no taste and was chewy like they put the hoagie in the microwave but didn't because you can watch them preparing your food through the glass windows.  Now, if they put their steaks on Leidenheimer's bread, OMG!!! It'll be perfect! I looked at Geno's bread and theirs looked more like the French bread in NOLA. I'll try them on my way back to the airport and give my review.  But overall, I enjoyed Pat's steaks and will definitely try a different one next time.

Enjoying a Philly cheese steak was to be one of the highlights for my husband during our vacation, so of course we had to try Pat's and Geno's, which we decided to eat at both locations on the same day.  That was a smart decision, because after experiencing Pat's, I would have refused to spend money on transportation to go back and even try Geno's.   

With all the notoriety, you would think between the two locations; one could make a Philly cheese steak that we could boast about when we returned home!   Pat's sandwich (grilled onions and provolone) was not heated at all, the roll was extremely hard, and the meat had so much fat that after 2 bites, I couldn't handle the experience any longer.   Even my husband gave up trying to eat it.  However, I decided not to waste all my money, so I proceeded to feed the roll to the 100 pigeons that surrounded us while we tried to eat.  

Still adventurous or dumb we proceeded across the street to Geno's.  The best part of the meal was there were less pigeons!  However, the Philly cheese steak (grilled onions and cheese whiz) was nothing to praise either.  The meat and roll were easier to chew/digest than Pat's, but the overall flavor was lacking!  Basically, more money down the drain.

After having lunch at Jim's (my friend said that's where the locals think is one of the best cheesesteaks), the bar was set at a decent height. 
Pat's was the first place I tried a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with Cheese wiz. My whole order was - Wiz Wit (cheese wiz and onions on the sandwich), American Wit (white American cheese w/ onions), and Cheese Fries. 
From what I had heard about this place, my expectations were low, but they were actually better than I expected. We ate at one of the tables outside, so everything was as fresh as it was gonna be......and I was surprised by 2 things....First, their bread was good, but it wasn't as fresh as Geno's or Jim's. Next, I was surprised that they didn't melt the American cheese....just put two slices down, dumped some warm (not hot) meat and onions on it and gave it to me. 
Cheese fries were ok, but nothing special. Both sandwiches were good (meat tasted better at Geno's and at Jim's). Service was ehh.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Juliet volunteers to order, having boned up on proper etiquette. There is a window for cheese steaks, and another window for drinks and fries. While she waits in the longer line, I acquire a Birch Beer and some cheese fries. Signs in the windows proclaim Geno's support for Trump in the next Presidential race; warnings if you don't speak English or you don't order correctly; and plenty of star-spangled banners. It feels like I'm at a Tea Party rally.

With a bit of luck and patience, we secure a small picnic table and unveil the beast. We tear the foot long in half, then dig in. The bread is soft; the shaved meat is juicy; the onions are sweet, weeping; and the Cheese Whiz is...well, Cheese Whiz. In the end, it is nothing special, just a somewhat thin sub with some anemic, salty, and overly-processed ingredients. The Birch Beer does wonders to wash it down. The cheese fries are pretty good, though. Better than the sandwich.

Eager to work our way up the food chain, we cross the street and prepare for Pat's. I step up this time to order, paying close attention to the instructions printed next to the window. I say, ""One provolone wit"". Translation: ""One cheesesteak with provolone cheese and with onions."" I feel like a local when the guy takes my money, hands back the change, and another guy shoves a sub at me. I'm getting the hang of this!

Unfortunately, there are no available seats. People are like scavengers, rushing to the nearest open picnic table and wolfing down their late lunches. We end up at one of the standing rails, clustered close together against the brisk wind. The sandwich tears apart easily. I take my first bite and prepare for the onslaught of meat and cheese...only to be met with nothing. Nada. Zip. Bupkis. I don't taste bread, meat, onions, or cheese. What in tarnation?

I eat more slowly, rolling each bite around on my tongue, trying to tease the flavors out. Still, it eludes me. The preparation is either too light a touch, or Geno's has ruined me. Maybe that's their secret weapon: ruin your taste buds before you try the competition.

Growing up I've always heard of the legendary Philly Cheese steak, how deliciously awesome it was, how I HAD to have one when if ever I was to visit Philly.

Finally had the chance to venture into Philly and having heard so much about Pat's being one of the original cheese steak establishments, I decided to give them a try.

Long story short:

The staff is rude and rushes you out ( People travel from all over to try your food, at least say a hello and let us know you APPRECIATE our patronage)

The cheese steak had barely any meat in it, covered with runny, watered down cheez whiz, served on a bun that was so chewy it was almost impossible to eat. ( THIS is the legendary cheese steak everyone was talking about? No way! )

The only reason why this place does so well is because of its reputation of being one of the firsts, if not for that I bet it probably wouldn't of even done half as good as they've been doing.

.:. Parking sucks. We get lucky sometimes, but there have also been visits when we circled for close to an hour. 
.:. It's cash only. The last time we went there, we were amused to see this policy provoke a fight between two friends, one of whom didn't have any cash. Come on, guys. It's not quaint; it's inconvenient. 
.:. People are rude there, both staff and patrons. I know, I know, it's their Philly thing, but it gets old after awhile.
.:. Long lines. Sometimes longer than others, but always pretty long. 
.:. No bathroom. Last time we went there we had to go across the street and buy a beer to relieve ourselves in the bar's bathroom. Which was fine, since we were pretty thirsty after not having enough cash to afford sandwiches AND sodas. 

Okay, I sound like a big complainer now, so let me say that their cheese steaks really do produce spontaneous cravings. I've never had a better one. The bread is chewy and light, similar to a French baguette. The steak is thinly shaved, although a little bland (and there's almost always a couple of tough pieces I have to discretely spit into my napkin.)

Let's face it, you're looking at this page because you read in your guidebook that Pat's Steaks was the go-to place for cheesesteaks.  Don't go here, seriously.  A clear majority of locals don't.  Use Yelp (yup, it's the website you are currently reading) to find one of many better cheesesteak places in the city.  Hell, there are quite a few good ones in Center City that don't require you to get down to South Philly.  There's probably one near your hotel that's better than Pat's.  And if you're staying in the Philly burbs?  Guess what, there are a bunch of mom-and-pop places that make killer cheesesteaks.  Just do some more research, it'll be worth it in the end.

I really don't understand how they became so famous.  Their steaks are decent, but not amazing.  They're not so magical that a unicorn trots around the corner to congratulate me on my ordering technique (seriously, if you get upset because I ask for ""a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms"" then you've got issues).  They are not so glorious that angels descend from the clouds to trumpet my appreciation for the perfect mixture of greasy meat and Cheese Whiz.  No dude.  

These are greasy steaks that will make you bloated for the rest of the afternoon, assembled by a staff of locals who are in a pissy mood and will fuss at you if you don't order their product in the exact way they dictate.  And every time I've eaten here (it's probably around 5 times by now thanks to friends/family that read that they aren't getting a real Philly steak without coming to Pat's or Geno's), I bloat up like a zeppelin.  Forget walking around the rest of the afternoon after eating one of these...

last two times i was in Philly, i got one from each, sat down, took a bite from Pat's, and then a bite from Geno's. I think the onions and bread from Pat's put them over the top. 

my favorite from Pat's is cheese steak wit onions, wiz and provolone. yeah I'm going to die soon. but it's so effing good! way better than Jim's, and way better than the other random spots i sadly stopped at in Philly. 

Geno's outward appearance is a sign of their food. well not really, but i don't like their glitzy neon covered building. and the rolls are too crunchy, too much bread covering the meatie cheesie goodness that's hidden inside. 

I've never had service problems from either. both have signs telling you how to order. read those and follow through and you'll be ok with getting your foods.

The menu had specific instructions on how to properly order a cheese steak, so I ordered a steak with onions and whiz trying not to look too much like a tourist. My mouth was watering and I couldn't wait to dig in, and was really disappointed after taking my first bite.  I guess I was expecting more of a Chicago style Italian beef taste (soft, juicy, flavorful), but the beef was bland, really chewy, and not at all tender. The only thing that gave it good flavor was the cheese whiz and grilled onions. The cheese whiz was definitely the way to go. It tasted like a thick liquid version of the good old American slice of cheese..... Soooo yummy.

""Eight dollars.  NEXT!""

That's it.  That's all it takes.

There is a difference between gruff and rude, a distinction subtle enough for the Easily Offended to miss.

The few times I've been to Pat's they've been gruff, but they've never been rude.  And that's OK.  The line is long and they want to keep it moving.  It's hot as hell back there they're grumpy.  

But some people are expecting rudeness and end up acting rudely themselves; sort of a preemptive strike.  In return, they do get the rudeness.  And they deserve it.

You're never going to see these people again, so why waste time (yours or theirs) by making idle chit-chat.  There's 30 people behind you, so why waste time hemming and hawing over what to order.  Know what you want and say it.  

There's also no accounting for good taste.  I find their gruffness to be part of the charm of eating here, the way that my feet sticking to the floor adds to the charm of going to a movie.

Oh, the food?  You want to know about the food?  

Well, it's a Philly Cheesesteak.  Now, I'm not a fan of saying, ""It is what it is"" but.....

Yeah, it is what it is.

And it's the best cheesesteak I've had.  The meat is chopped up so that it mixes with the cheese and onions to provide balanced flavor.  The cheese Whiz is hot and melty.  The bread is firm enough to handle the weight of the filling without being too hard to chew comfortably.  And the steak still tastes like steak through it all.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to cruise I-95 between Philly and Boston to figure out where a Cheesesteak magically becomes a Steak And Cheese.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

However after taking down the sandwich that whiz flavor just did it in for me.  My mouth was having a party with all the onions and cheese whiz firing off all of my taste buds.  I do have to admit that the steak itself was a little dry and not as fatty, though the grill looked super greased up from all the steak they were cooking that day.

This is certainly not the best steak in the city and it is kind of a touristy spot, but I hate all the Philadelphians saying it is garbage or not even average. An average cheesesteak is one you get at a pizza place. This is definitely better than that. It's almost like people have to prove that they know the best place that no one ever heard of. And yes, my review of Geno's is VERY similar to this, because they really are very similar. 

The prices are ridiculous now (close to $10!), but I admit it is still a guilty pleasure. A sloppy wiz wit' at 3 am after a night of drinks is tough to beat. I usually hit Pat's and/or Geno's once a year, after a long day of drinking at the Mummer's Parade. It still hits the spot.

The great debate over who has the better cheesesteak, Pat's or Geno's just adds to the marketing hype that benefits both long time establishments.  Since they are located across the street from one another, you know you're going to end up trying both.  Most of my friends in Philly actually recommend Tony Luke's.

Pat's sandwich was well seasoned and significantly less greasy than Geno's.  My recommendation is buy 2 cheesteaks from Pat's and skip Geno's.

I got it right, you're out of order, that's not by the rules (I so want to point at the sign here, but I am restrained). So Man-in-White yells out the order to his grill man, who piles on the meat (from the ""Wit side"") onto a bun. From what I see, this is his only job. Man-in-White gets the meat-filled bun, and wielding what looks like a large cake frosting blade, withdrawn from the Steaming Thermal Cheese Cauldron much as one would envision King Arthur withdrawing Excalibur, he slathers on the orange Whiz onto my sandwich,  wraps it faster than a cobra strikes its prey, and puts it in my to-go bag. Disappointed, and feeling a little let down, I pay for my sandwich, grab a few peppers from the pile at the ""serve yourself stand"" behind me, and I leave.

A short time later in the comfort of my hotel room, the cheesesteak still amazingly hot, I dig in. The bun is fantastic. It is crusty on the outside, it is chewy, and it has a nice soft interior. This is indeed the perfect cheesesteak bun. One could not want for more. The Cheez Whiz? Excellent choice. It fills the cracks and crevices with its warm, salty, creamy goodness. And then there's the meat -Oh -  tough, chewy, and under seasoned. It is sliced to the right thickness, but when you bite into it, you can't get your teeth through the meat. It is difficult to even do that thing where you unceremoniously hold onto the meat that extends just past your incisors and pull, without dragging the meat beyond out of the bun. I barely see an onion, and one would be hard pressed knowing they were in there unless you were looking. I try one of the peppers and ....""Holy 911!"", now that's a pepper! Now I like spicy, but these are tongue numbing hot. So just be warned.

Well, disappointed overall, especially with a $9.50 price tag just a sandwich. You're paying for the name here it seems, not the quality. At least not what I got. It was edible, but just not the soft, tender, fall apart tender cheesesteak I have come to expect from elsewhere. Next time I'm here, maybe I'll try Geno's.

Pats wins by far.

Pats gives more meat that was much more tender and flavorful
You also get way more cheese whiz

The downsides:
The bread isn't as good as the other two though but its still good

Also it costs $10 here vs $9.50 at Genos and $8.60 at Jims

Genos gave a larger roll and had a nice toasted bread which beats them all

Jim's has a better price and gives more meat than Genos.

Pats wins!

The cheese was not as melted and it didn't create a mess for me when I took my bite. Onions were good with the sandwich. But you can order the it without it if you don't like it.

Coming back here today...not so much. Line was not long. Waited maybe 5 minutes. They are fast service. But they are rude and mean if you do not say your order right. I said hello to them and they don't even respond. just ""NEXT!!! NEXT!!!"" The cashier looked busy shuffling back and forth so i waited until he stood still and looked at me. He did not, and just kept screaming ""NEXT!!! NEXT!!!"" I gave up and just yelled my order at him. Ordered a mushroom cheesesteak wit wiz (mushroom cheesesteak with onions with cheese wiz). Found a spot and sat down. Bread was super chewy almost tasted stale, there was a huge chunk of meat that I bit into that was completely stuck together. I wasn't even sure if it was fully cooked. I still ate it because I was hungry. The juice from the steak sogging up my bread was good and helped to chew it easier. 

Nonetheless. the entire thing was just...OK. Didn't blow my mind.

Anyone who's ever watched anything on Food Network knows Pat's and Geno's have this ""long bitter rivalry"" because their right across the street from each other.

The set up is much the same as Geno's. There are two windows, one for purchasing cheesesteaks, and the other for everything. Since this was a tour my boyfriend and I were doing, we just bought one cheesesteak and split it between us. 

Before we even got to the window there was a problem. The woman in front of us held out her cheesesteaks to the cashier and was telling him she paid for extra cheese. She said there was no extra cheese on her cheesesteak. The guy, pretty rudely, told her that there was no way he could add any more cheese because once it's been cooked, that's it. He said, ""You got what you ordered. We make what you order!"" The woman kept saying that she ordered extra cheese and she paid for extra cheese but the argument was over. The guy shooed her away and she left upset. Not the best customer service! It would've been no big deal to drip on some extra cheese at the window like they do for all their sandwiches. But I guess customer service isn't a top priority for Pat's when they already have tons of other customers waiting. This put me off a bit but we still wanted to try Pat's.

We ordered the usual, wiz wit'. It came out super fast, with ooey gooey melty cheese wiz on top that was drizzled on fresh. We grabbed napkins and scoped out a seat around the triangle. Once we really took a bite of our sandwich, it was delicious! The cheese had formed a slight film at the top but it didn't make the cheese any less ooey gooey! The onions and the chopped meat were perfect together. The bread was soft, and ripped off easily. The cheese, was EVERYWHERE on top! It didn't penetrate into the meat like I wish it would've, but every bite was still yummy. My boyfriend basically declared Pat's his favorite cheesesteak! This was after we had eaten at Geno's, which btw tastes like ripped up old cardboard.

So, 4 stars for Pat's! It would've been 5 stars if not for the whole CS mess ahead of us with the woman, and for the cheese not quite layered into the meat. Outside of that, woweee!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The cheesesteak was great, but I wouldn't say that you can't get one that good outside of Philly. But I think most places outside of the area don't offer Whiz out of an irrational fear of being gross. Everything was quite tender and juicy though. And the peppers you can put on the cheesesteak at the condiment station are an awesome compliment. I just ate them whole, stem and all on the cheesesteak, and didn't regret it for a minute even as I felt each pepper land in my stomach with increasing weight and fire.

I'll have to come back some day to try Geno's and see how the two match up; I'll also have to give John's Roast Pork a try, as I hear that it's actually the dark horse favorite for both roast pork sandwiches and cheesesteaks, but when we tried to go on this trip it was closed for the weekend.

When you visit Philadelphia, people will tell you to head to Pat's for it's reputation alone, as well as it's location right next to the other top contender, Geno's Steaks. 

In my opinion, cheesesteaks are something very difficult to rate. Some people like Cheese Whiz, others prefer provolone. Some prefer their steak chopped up, others like it still in slices. 

Pat's uses a great roll for the bread, soft and as good as those used by any other place. They then slather it with Cheese Whiz and top it with chopped prime rib steak. It's a great cheesesteak, and their cheese fries are an incredible addition to an already filling meal. 


It's a little on the pricey side, but so are all of the big name cheesesteak places (Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's, and Jim's). It's also unfortunately a little out of the way for a lot of people, but if you are just visiting the city I would absolutely recommend you try it. 

I give it four stars simply because there are better options in the city when you have time to explore. Jim's is delicious and probably my favorite of the big-4, with Tony Luke's and Pat's tied for 2nd. 

Overall, it's a great place for tourists to visit, and the fun of choosing a side on the Pat's vs. Geno's war is half the reason to go. If you live in the city, there are better options, cheaper options, and a lot of preference to be had.

Result?  INCONCLUSIVE.

Pat's - Pros:
- Lots & lots of cheese whiz.
- Thick(er), delicious pizza fries.
- Better, softer, hoagie.
- Cheesesteak add-ons such as mushrooms, peppers, and pizza sauce.

Pat's - Cons:
- Dirtier.  No pretty tables or clean condiment bar.
- Ruder service.  If you don't get the ordering system right, you got to move to the back of the line.

Geno's - Pros:
- Thicker slices of meat.
- Stronger onion flavour.
- Clean restaurant decorated in bright orange colours.
- Neon-lit environment.  Like the Boardwalk!
- Nice service.  They actually wrap and bag your sandwich.  At Pat's, they throw it at you on a piece of wax paper.

Geno's - Cons:
- Not as much cheese.  Less cheese, less fun!
- Thin, McDonald-esqe fries.  Again, less cheese.
- Lack of cheesesteak toppings - no mushrooms, peppers, pizza sauce, or anything else.

Overall:
Better Food: Pat's!
Better Experience: Geno's!

Other tips:
- Only outdoor seating at both places, so be prepared to sacrifice the tips of your fingers to frostbite during the colder months.  Or, alternatively, order to go.
- Learn how to order.  First, specify what cheese (cheese whiz - the classic!, American, or provolone) you want.  Second, specify whether or not you want onions. For example, ""whiz with"" translates into ""cheesesteak with cheese whiz with onions"".  At Pat's, tack on the toppings you want following your order.
- Geno's & Pat's are probably tourist traps.  I definitely believe that there are better places in the city to get your cholesterol fix, but you got to try the classics at least once!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Geno's was .50 more to add peppers, but had a lot more peppers then Pat's.  They did not have as much cheese on sandwich.

As the ""creator"" of the cheesesteak, Pat's may need to revamp its original recipe. He scored worst in both meat and topping quality with dissatisfaction stemming from ""flavorless"", ""fatty"" meat and an overwhelming cry for more cheese. As the sixth place finisher scoring 6.9, Pat's forte was represented in the aroma category - where he ranked first.

Historical legacy isn't everything, apparently. Pat's delivers the worst meat quality and worst toppings of all eight competitors. Well...at least it smelled tasty?

I have to say, I wasn't overly impressed with either.  I'll say it; we can get a much better cheesesteak from any pizza place/sub shop back home in Buffalo.  That being said, here's what I thought:

Geno's:    Delicious roll.  Nice and dense and chewy, I preferred it much more than Pat's.  The steak is served whole, in slices, but there is not a lot of meat at ALL to fill up that dense, chewy roll.  I got mine ""wit"" onions, but they weren't cooked down enough and weren't overly soft.  Also, they were piled right in the middle of the roll, so the proportions were off until I opened it up and used my finger to redistribute it along the whole roll.  The cheez wiz on Geno's meat liquefied and melted off, dripping off onto the paper.      
The seating and atmosphere at Geno's is much nicer, it's very well lit, cleaner, and more tourist-friendly.  I have to say, though, it was awkward standing behind some foreign customers (speaking to each other in a different language) and watching as they saw the article taped to the window and the sign stating to ""Speak English"".  They took some pictures of the signs and laughed, but still... awk-ward.     We went in January and there was basically no one waiting in line outside.  The only place to eat is outside, too, so prepare to freeze your hands off as you devour your food!  Also:  separate ordering windows for steaks vs fries, but I didn't notice a SIGN saying such, just the irritated girl at the window telling people to go down to the next window to order fries.   Seemed weird, especially since there was no one waiting. 

Pat's:    Less inviting location, not all lit up as well as Geno's.  Signage seemed older and more beat up.    The roll was good, perfectly acceptable but not as amazing as Geno's.  There was LOTS more meat than Geno's , which is definitely more my style.  Pat's chops their steak up, which, I discovered, might be an easy way to disguise that their meat isn't as high quality as Geno's since there was LOTS of gristle in my sandwich and none on Geno's.   The cheese wiz didn't melt away into oblivion on the Pat's sandwich, which was nice.  The onions were OVERdone, however, with a burnt taste to some of them.  The onions were nicely disbursed through the chopped up meat, but that only meant I got the burnt taste through my whole cheesesteak since I couldn't scrape them off.   

So in Summary: - Pros and cons to each which made it impossible to choose which was better.  Wish I could make a combo of the two to make one perfect sandwich!   

 Geno's= Much less steak but nicer quality steak in solid slices.  Better roll.  Cheez wiz melts away and drips off the roll.  More dense/less cooked onions piled right in the middle. 

Pat's:  Much more steak, cut up/diced up and very full of gristle/fat.  Onions mixed in well throughout but overdone and some were burnt.  Cheez wiz stayed intact and blended well with the beef in each slice.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I came here on a Saturday afternoon and both places were packed with people. Out of town tourists looking to try the famous Philly cheesesteak, no doubt. I would know, I was one of those people. The Travel Channel told me this was the place to be. After a few minutes of debating, my friends and I decided to line up at Pat's, the less flashy looking place of the two. The line was long, but it moved fairly fast. We waited for about 15-20 minutes before our orders were taken by Pat. Yes, Pat of Pat's King of Steaks. I got a ""cheese, wit"" (Cheez whiz, onions, meat and bread) and it was pretty good. I don't know if it was the best I've ever had, but it was good enough. It's best eaten piping hot or else the cheez whiz will start to congeal (yuck). You can add ketchup or peppers to your steak but I prefer to consume it as I ordered it. Pure, unadulterated meat, cheese and bread. 

Also, if you order your steak with any other cheese other than cheez whiz, the cheese won't be melted onto your steak. My friend ordered her steak with provolone and they just slapped some cheese between the bread and meat. She ended up taking some cheez whiz from our cheese fries and pouring it onto her steak. The lesson here? Don't mess with the original.

The service is curt and impersonal, but what do you expect? I would be like that too if I had to serve hundreds and hundreds of people all day long. The seating is limited.

We ordered one sandwich with onions and provelone and another with onions and cheese whiz.  It's def. better with the cheese whiz, but, the cheese was only on one part of the sandwich which left a lot of the meat whiz-less.  And there weren't too many onions.  :/

The opinions/complaints you'll find on Pat's are mostly correct - it's not the best cheesesteak you can get, there are no frills, it's a little overpriced, and don't expect any friendly banter at the counter. You say your ""wiz wit"" and fork over cash (it's cash only), take your cheesesteak and move out. If you're fussy or want something special, you can go pretty much anywhere else for that.

Unlike Jim's, the cheesesteak is just okay. Edible? Yes. Not the best cheesesteak, but not terrible. I guess I am paying for an experience, and that is okay. It is not terribly expensive either. It probably would have been had I ordered fries. Thankfully, I refrained.

So I decided to go with Pat's since I heard it was much better. Well going there I didn't know it was cash only. Luckily I had exact amount for a cheese steak sandwich. Which cost me $10. And it sucks they don't take credit or debit cards. They would get so much more business if they did. Well finding parking was a pain first of all. Such a small area that I was lucky to get a spot across the road. Then the line on a weekday was super short. It does go by quick. However the guy at the register seems to not care about waiting cause he makes you order so fast. You need to know you're order and how to order before you get up to the register which is annoying cause being a first time customer you don't know. So I unfortunately ordered the wrong cheese cause I was rushed. The guy just wanted the money and for you to leave. Then I got the cheese steak and it lack flavor. The cheese wasn't melted which sucked. Overall the hype of Pat's was so bad. I possibly might return but probably try Geno's. or neither and find another place.,"Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

A friend of mine brought us here and had us get one from here and one from Gino's across the street to compare and contrast how good and nasty these are! 

I have to say that the bread and the meat both are MUCH better at Pat's and actually would never go back to Gino's. The line is about the same length in both (I'm assuming people have the same mentality as us to compare?). 

I can't give 4 or 5 star because of two reasons:
- They use their bare hands for everything, how do people not get hepatitis, diarrhea, food poisoning? The cashier guy collected money, licked his fingers to count my change, put meat on our sandwich, added cheese -- all with his bare hands. 
- This sandwich was good -- but $10? Not worth it. 

Overall, the sandwich was pretty decent and next time visiting Philly, I'd probably come again. It's more-so a ""good experience"" kind of like the 53rd and 6th Halal carts in NYC.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I came here after perusing through the Italian Market, and after eating my sandwich, I regretted not eating somewhere - anywhere - at the Italian Market instead.

100% touristy and gimmicky, overpriced, greasy and messy, tastes like a waste of space, provolone not melted, not enough places to sit and eat, distasteful clientele.

I know that this isn't the local favorite for cheesesteaks in this city, but my tourist intuition told me to go here for a memorable experience. My sister had recommended against Geno's (""I've had better in Burbank, CA,"" she said), and I personally didn't care to financially support their political agenda anyway, so I chose Pat's. I'm guessing that there may not be much difference in quality or service, however.

Sorry, cheez whiz is disgusting in general. I instead ordered ""one provolone wit."" I paid my $9.50, and literally within 5-10 seconds, my sandwich appeared at the window. They spend more time and care making my sandwiches at Subway. I should have paid attention as soon as I picked up my cheesesteak from the counter, because the worker took out his towel and wiped down the greasy juices from the counter top where my food had just been... and as I walked around the building to find a table to sit and eat, the same greasy juices spilled right over my shirt and jeans. Gahh. Thank you, Pat's, for letting me walk around like this for the rest of the day (I spent the evening trying to scrub down my clothes in my hotel sink with a bar of soap).

I found a seat at a table as soon as a couple of other patrons finished their sandwich and left, and then sat about to eat my cheesesteak. I didn't like that the provolone wasn't melted, probably because they just slap a couple slices on the bread in the 5 seconds after your order. The meat tasted flavorless to me and the whole thing tasted like a waste of stomach space and calories to me. I rarely ever do this, but after eating my way 2/3 through the cheesesteak, I decided I was better off just tossing the remainder. Yes, I suspect that the cheesesteaks probably do taste better in Burbank...

And while I was sitting at my little table, a group of six Asian guys decided that there was nowhere else to eat, and just sat down and crowded the table with me and hovering around me as I ate. I get it, you guys are so awesome and badass that you can just overtake a lone girl's table without the shred of decency to ask if it's OK, or any sense of how uncomfortable and weird it is for me to have to sit among your thug selves as you swear up a storm talking about your cars and your women. Yes, you guys are so thug in your American Eagle Outfitters t-shirts. Pat's, if this is in any way representative of your normal patrons, I think I hate your dumb clientele more than your food.

So, I have a friend from Ukraine visiting the area who has never been to Philly...seemed logical to get him a cheesesteak.  Pulled up to the corner and chose Pat's, mainly because I parked closer to it and I don't really know the difference yet.  

Huge line, but moved fast.  Friendly, efficient service.  Why the one star?  At the risk of getting hate messages from Pat's lovers, the sandwich was a HUGE disappointment.  The meat was scarce and tough/dry, and the bread was excessively chewy.  Those combined to form a sandwich I could barely bite through.  I've had MUCH better cheesesteaks in many other places, without paying $11 for them.  

To add insult to injury, there was a huge shortage of seating mostly caused by people holding seats forever while the rest of their party waits in line for the food.  Where I come from, the custom is to NOT hold seats and let the people with the food have the tables!  If executed properly and courteously (meaning don't linger after eating when you can see the place is slammed), this system works well such that by the time you get your food there will be a table for you.  Sheesh people amaze me sometimes!

Rule #1 when going to Pats or Geenos or even Tony Lukes. Watch Seinfield's Soup Nazi ahead of time, don't ask question just do it. Because you don't want to be that Eileen... EVER! Know what you want, understand the lingo, listen to how the locals and people ahead of you are ordering, and practice it while you're in line. Don't talk to your friend while you're in line, just keep repeating silently it until you're up to the cashier and your tongue/throat has been physically trained to say those magic words. ""Steak wit wiz and onion""

Then have the money and more specifically the paper bill ready in your hands, with appropriate speed when handing to the cashier, and ready to receive change. Then proceed on to receive your cheesesteak, and move to your left if you require additional fussing to pick it up properly. Use both hands as you will need it to hold the torpedo of joy that will invade your mouth, hmm that was dirty....

At this point your interaction with the cheesesteak woman or man is done, and god help you if you for one second decide to try and strike up a conversation. Then proceed on to your left to the french fries and soda section. This is less formal, and you may be given leniency on how you order, as long as there is no line. Otherwise its simply fries and soda wit wiz. No they will not put wiz in your soda, unless you're a complete idiot who engages them in mindless drivel.  

Finally, sit down at a seat or bench and enjoy your food. Follow these rules or you will be given the ""No-Soup-For-You!"" equivalent of South Philly.

Time of Visit: Monday, 8:00PM

So a friend visits from out of town and wants an eponymous cheesesteak sandwich: where do you take them?  Jim's, Geno's, Pat's, or other?

We decided on Pat's.  My friend was a little nervous about their ordering rules (wit or witout onions, second window for fries & drinks), which was exacerbated by the fact a class-trip sized group of school kids got off a bus after we got to the window.  I'm not afraid to admit it: I need more than 5 seconds to make sure I say my order correctly...sue me.

The staff at the counter, while not the most friendly people on the planet, were not as mean as some other yelpers have encountered in their visits.  My mushroom pepper steak with provolone was pretty good: it came out very hot, with a lot of steak.

If you're going to Pat's, you're going for the cheesesteak only; nothing else.  While I appreciate tradition and longevity as much as the next person, that doesn't mean you can lower your level of service (read: treat your customers poorly) and assume everyone will continue to flock to your establishment (excluding 8th graders on field-trips).","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

my brother lives near the italian market in south philly.  I went for a visit.  Luckily for me my brother and his girlfriend are foodies.  I was able to taste many different cuisines in Philly.  Coming from San Francisco, there are places I don't go due to the tourist trap aura, due to the non-authenticity of it all (fisherman's wharf, chinatown etc).  But when I was in Philly I had to have a cheesesteak...and I had to go to the two most famous places, which of course are right across the street from one another,  in a big rivalry, and featured on the Food Netowrk!  How cheesy, but essential.  
We split two, both ""wit whizt '?(cheese whiz)One from Geno's and one from Pat's.

Honestly, I thought that Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's cheesesteaks where all about equally as good, which is to say, I enjoyed them, but don't have a burning desire to return for more. 

The draw of Pat's is that it is the origin of the whole Philly cheesesteak phenomenon (although Geno's claims that they were the ones who started putting cheese on them). As other's have mentioned, Pat's is rather unassuming compared to Geno's across the street; this, when combined with Pat's historical signpost, lends an air of authenticity that some may find attractive. 

Like Geno's (and unlike Jim's) I didn't find the wait to be terrible here, but they do rush you through. The cheesesteaks and the drinks are a bit overpriced, which I suppose is to be expected for such a tourist draw. When I went here, the cashier tried to short change me $10. 

To be honest, I'd rate Pat's as just about the same as Geno's. I think it's worth going once, but it's not a place worth visiting with any degree of frequency.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Then a month or two ago, we flew in together and I had the chance to eat a fresh cheesesteak. It was by no means the best I've ever had, but it was meat, cheese, and bread. Hard to fuck that up. In other words, I enjoyed it. 

The signage out front was a bit intimidating. It was ordering instructions. They were uncomplicated, but it had a ""hurry the fuck up"" vibe to it. Also, when I ordered through the window, it seemed like they were a little rude. Not that I expected great customer service from an assembly line worker feeding faceless cattle, but I guess that adds to the authenticity... rudeness. I'm sure it's necessary when it's busy and there's a line down the street. It was pretty empty when we were there. 

The sandwich wasn't so much lovingly crafted as it was just scoop, plop, schluuuurp, wrap, and shove out the window. Part of the experience. 

Well, it was the same basic cheesesteak you could get anywhere. Nothing special about the meat or the bread. Same shit you can get any place. The cheese was wiz, so not even really cheese.

-Bread flavor is overall better than of Geno's

Negs:
-Meat here is a little dry. More moist and tender at Gino's

It has always and will continue to hold a special place in my heart.  More often when I return, I don't go for the food, but for the sentimental value I have attached to this world-famous South Philly cheesesteak stand.  In the battle of Pat's versus Geno's, I'm definitely Team Pat's.  But while Pat's dominates the local neighborhood, there are much better (and far less crowded) cheesesteak stands in Philadelphia.

By all means, if you have friends coming in from out of town and they want to get a cheesesteak, Pat's should be your go-to.  After you wait in line for what seems like forever, the steak comes out fast and dripping in velvety cheez whiz and grease.  Don't even think about ordering it without onions, and for extra cheesesteak deliciousness, ask to remove the insides of the soft-yet-sturdy Amoroso roll (""guts out"" in linespeak).  Next, get in the other line and grab yourself a red cherry soda (and fries if you must, though certainly not required), help yourself to some ketchup for your steak and some hot peppers and find a table.  Begin by eating the peppers whole to put some heat in your mouth, then sink your teeth into a time-honored tradition.  The meat is incredibly tender and the cheese acts both as a complement and a sauce to hold the sandwich together and accentuate the flavors.  Nevermind that it is mustard yellow and doesn't resemble a food product: this is far and away the best kind of cheese to put in your steak.

But there are many other great cheesesteak places outside the Pat's and Geno's sphere that demand your attention and put Pat's to shame.  You can find them at Reading Terminal Market, in Roxborough, farther down in South Philly, and even in West Philly.  Furthermore, unless you know how to order the right way or know what you want before getting in line, do not attempt ordering at the window.  Pat's is the quintessential Philadelphia Cheesesteak experience, but it is definitely not the best.  While it is arguably the standard by which cheesesteaks in this city are judged, there are many options that exceed the quality and flavor that Pat's serves.  Nevertheless, Pat's is consistent.

We began our adventure at Pat's.  

You can find Pat's off of Wharton street, and literally a stone's throw away across the street is Geno's, so these guys are competitors in the truest sense of the word. It also makes it easy to sample both at the same time if you desire (we did). 

From the moment you stand in line, there's a series of steps on how to order a steak (i.e. learn to use ""wit"" a lot).  We did decide on getting their Cheese steak ($11).  Pat's does have some optional toppings you can add opposite their store front which are all on the house.  

The Philly meat comes chopped and in terms of flavors, I preferred Pat's over Geno's.  Their meat was packing a little more flavor to me than Geno's, and if I had to pick between the two, i'd go to Pat's first. The sandwich is served whole, so if you want to share with someone, you'll have to tear it in half (staff would not cut the sandwich for us).

Flavor, ironically is the only win that Pat's has over Geno's, which some would argue is all they need...flavor.   Geno's has it all over Pat's in terms of price, cleanliness, customer service (they happily cut our sandwiches), but flavor is all Pat's .

So, in the war between Pat's or Geno's, I wouldn't travel to Philly to experience either of these two popular tourist spots. Truth be told, there are much more tasty sandwiches in other parts of Philly, but if you find yourself in the area, you probably will get a little more flavor squeezed out of Pat's.  But don't take my word on it.  

Give these guys a try if you're close and willing!

There are a lot of people writing reviews about Pats that make solid points.  I won't go into another detailed review. But I will point out the things I have read from other reviews that are true and false in my opinion.

True: 
-You can get a ""better"" cheesteak somewhere else. Just research on yelp. 
-Pat's is STILL a good place to eat despite getting a ""better"" steak somewhere else. 
-The steak line will be long, but moves fast. Fries and soda line never long. 
-Pat's is better than Genos. 
-Parking is not always available right up front you tourists, not everyplace can be like your beloved Applebees. This is South Philly, not Orlando. 
-They have never won any customer service awards. So stop reviewing their ""service."" They hand you a freaking steak and you hand them money. Don't be stupid. 
-Yes, you need to know what you want before you get up there. It's not like you were not informed about this requirement. 
-Yes their cheese fries are spectacular

False:
-whoever says that locals don't go here and only tourists do, doesn't actually know any locals. Locals still go to both Pat's and Geno's. 
-if you are from California, and say that these steaks are expensive, go fist yourself. I've never eaten a meal under $30 in that entire state.  
-regardless of your dining expectations, these guys are not here to coddle your balls. act accordingly and simply eat your steak. 
-the staff, is actually quite pleasant if you are not a dipshit. 
-Pat's or Geno's do not have terrible sandwiches. 
-this is not fine dining. and 3 stars means exactly that: A-ok
-pats is never dirty
-you did not eat a better cheesteak in California. Tofu steaks are not cheesteaks.

However, the steak at Geno's was watery. 

Overall, both locations are quite similar and great choices. We would have to say we liked Geno's more.

Since this is Philadelphia, and this is the east coast, definitely make up your mind before you come up to order. The line goes by pretty quickly but people get pretty impatient when you take your time to order.

Essentially, I saw  all these tough guys behind the counter pause for a minute to welcome me as an outside, talk more about their restaurant and neighborhood's history and love for the blessings they have had in life.  

Maybe not the best sandwich I have ever had...but I am definitely glad that I tried out this American original at the original restaurant and experience it with a true local.

The place is a fast food place that you walk up to and order. They have picnic tables for seating that surrounds the entire place. You can see their rivalry right across from them.

So when I was in Philly you just simply have to get a PHILLY CHEESESTEAK.  I came to Pat's King of Steaks after a previous soiree and I expected a line especially since it was Halloween (drunk people got to eat too right?).  There were none which was a mixed blessing in disguise I suppose.  

So...

I ordered Pat's Pepper Steak wid (yes it is wid down in Philly and not WITH up in NY) onions and no cheese (perhaps I should have been braver being partial lactose intolerant and just risked the bathroom run during my 2 hr drive back).  

The sandwich itself was LARGE I mean when you are paying $9.50 it better be an EFFING appropriated sized.  Pat's definitely packed it on with the steak.  They stuffed that bad boy like Thanksgiving dinner.  Food baby anyone?  

The flavor was a bit bland as I expected well more peppery flavor and ONIONS (I don't know if it was just an off night or just an off build on the particular sandwich I got but I'm pretty sure the onions are supposed to be on BOTH sides of the sandwich and not just one side which is what I got).  The other side...the BETTER side it was flavorful.  The onions gave the steak a real nice contrast with its tangy-ness and it was peppered well.  

A random thought.  Did my sandwich not come with napkins? Was it an extra charge? Was I suppose to take slabs of wood and make my own napkins?  Was it powdered into my sandwich?  It was nowhere to be found and I didn't see on the outside tables neither.
I was curious as if there was a sauce for it other than the obvious CHEESE in Philly CHEESE steak.  But I'd gladly try them again as it did fill my belly and the latter parts of the sandwich was what I envisioned the sandwich to be.

If Philly Cheese Steak joints are states, Pat's is definitely NEW YORK as the outside decor has a gritty feel to it.

Yeah, I actually, probably would not come back here again. There's really nothing wrong with the cheesesteak here, but it's just that this place is so out of the way, relative to where I would normally be hanging out in Philadelphia. There doesn't seem to be much to do in this neighborhood, and, and the septa doesn't get you super close either.

Still, the cheesesteak here is enjoyable. The price is okay for the amount of food you get (it's $11 for a cheesesteak with onions), and I opted for the cheese whiz, which is really a must. I kind of agree with the others when they say that there isn't much taste to the beef, but I honestly think I wouldn't have been able to taste it too well even if the quality was higher, on account of the cheese whiz taste. The bun is fine, and I enjoyed the outdoor seating- it was surprisingly clean given how popular this place seems to be. It's kind of annoying that this place is cash only, so it limited the amount of things I actually had money for- as a result, the cheesesteak is the only thing I got. I came at around 1:00 am, and this place is open 24 hours, so that is a pretty cool feature..

They seem to want to make a big deal about how long they've been doing this cheesesteak biz, or how they were the first ones, but I imagine most of that stuff matters very little to people. This isn't even the best cheesesteak in Philadelphia, so I don't think they should talk such a big game.

Bread was fresh - crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The wiz was flavorful and gave the moistness needed. The meat was not particularly juicy, but not overly dry - I do wish there was some more grease/fat though. The staff was friendly enough - but you better know what you want and how to order when you get to the register.

I could discern the difference.

It took me later after we were back to our Airbnb that I felt Pat's is ahead. I took a bite of Pat's then immediately took a bite of Geno's:

-Geno's has bigger (portion) meat and bigger bun. But the bigger bun I am afraid takes some away from the meat. Pat's thinner bun is 'collapsible' and compliments the beef better.
-Pat's chopped beef (along with my extras) tasted better than Geno's. It is truly indiscernible if you finish one sandwich after the other. But eaten alternately, the difference is very much present with Pat's flavor and taste moving ahead.

Naturally, since I've never tried a Philly cheesesteak, it was only logical to try one at the original restaurant!

We got two cheesesteaks with cheese whiz, for $10 each. There was virtually no line when we went, and they pretty much handed over the sandwich a minute (maybe less) after the order went in since all the components were pre-made. 

Original or not, I thought the food itself was pretty mediocre. The bread tasted quite processed (oddly chewy), the meat was a bit fatty and dry, and it's kind of hard to mess up cheese whiz. I liked how they had a pickle bar on the side, but did not like how they didn't have utensils (wanted to try cutting the sandwich in half).

I had a ""provolone wit"" (i.e., cheesesteak sandwich with provolone cheese and grilled onions).  The bread was stale and the cheese not melted.  Frankly, I've had better cheesesteaks at the mall in Albuquerque (seriously!).  For a better cheesesteak in the Philly area, try Dalessandro's.  Or skip the cheesesteak and get a fantastic hoagie at Primo's!!! .... Maybe I should've had it with whiz.

Of all the Rick Sebak documented sandwiches, Pat's and Geno's have been the only disappointments as of yet.  Still, these are both institutions in their own right, so I'm glad I came --- only because now I can say I've been here.

Oh, and be prepared for ridiculously long lines and a long walk to find parking.  There is no indoor seating.  Tables outside only (if you can find a free table).  Also (and I don't mean this as a criticism) if you're not from the area, you may perceive employees' manner as rude.  It really isn't.  It's just part of the South Philly 'tude.  Just roll wit it.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Long story short: If you gave me sliced beef, cheese, and some long bread, I can make a cheesesteak as good as Pat's. I'm not kidding at all.

There are some basic, simple foods that various restaurants have proclaimed to have the ""best"" or ""original"" and, whenever I have tried, I have responded with a big ""meh"". The reality is the gap between ""good"" and ""world's best"" for relatively simple foods like burgers, cheesesteaks, ramen, grilled cheese sandwich, mac and cheese, etc. is just not that huge.

Sure, someone can use USDA prime aged ribeye for the sliced meat in their cheesesteak and it would be better, but why would you slice $15-20/lb prime aged ribeye to use in a cheesesteak? Why wouldn't you eat it as a ribeye steak? Likewise, you can use prime aged ribeye ground up for a burger, but what kind of nutbag would you be to do that?

As another reviewer noted, the generic cheesesteak chain you see in the food courts offer cheesesteak that's as good as Pat's, and maybe better in many cases. Don't buy the hype.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

While they still argue over who was first, I'll let you be the judge as to whose tastes better. And since they are literally across the street from each other, I encourage you to do what we've always done and try them both for that real Philly experience. Besides, dinging either one of these places for taste would be like giving the Liberty Bell a bad rating because it has a crack in it and doesn't ring pure anymore. These places are historic institutions and the heart of some of Philly's heritage.

With that said, I've been coming here since the 80's and for my money right now have a slight leaning towards Geno's. Here's my breakdown:

Pat's:
* dryer bread and meat
* crunchy onions
* cheaper wiz
* harsher service

Geno's:
* juicy meat
* carmelized onions
* steamed roll
* gooey cheese
* friendlier staff

While they are both institutions, I prefer to have that greasy, juicy flavor dripping off my cheesteak. 

A couple final recommendations before stepping up to the window: read the instructions and learn the lingo. It's rather simple and broken down into but three steps. And bring cash, they don't take plastic. This will definitely make your experience a more memorable one.

Both of these places are famous for a reason and one of those ""must-see-stops"" on a tour of Philadelphia.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I went there last night with a group of friends. We're new students to Philly so we figured a Friday night would be a good time to check out this Pat's or Geno's cheesesteak rivalry. 
Coming from University City, we (barely) navigated the subway system and walked our way to 9th street. By this time, we were starving and we approached Geno's first. What newbie wouldn't? It's big flashy lights, bright, etc. We heard about those ""anti-immigrant"" rumors but I didn't care at first. Again, hungry. There was a big sign about no outside food, which I figured made sense. A review below me apparently shows how anal they are about it. 
We ditched that line and went to Pats after we saw the (large) woman wearing a ""I'm an American; I speak English"" t-shirt. Now, everyone in my group spoke English with no accent...however not all of us were ""white"" and my friend was afraid to order there. They also had some plaques about people who died in duty and a large one about some guy who died and put the name of the ""murderer"" there, obviously a muslim. Kind of the last straw.
Went to Pat's. Being outsiders, I was a little hesitant about ordering. Since I've heard they're pretty picky about it. Pat's had a nice sign telling you how to order. That was helpful. Ordering went without a hitch. While waiting in line just figure out what you're going to order and have your money out. 
$8.50 for a cheesesteak was pretty steep so we ate them without fries or drinks. Seating wasn't too hard to find, especially for a Friday night. One guy working there came out and chatted with a few customers. The cheesesteaks themselves weren't that great actually. My friend got the ""whiz"" and it oozed all over the place. It wasn't piping hot which was kind of disappointing. It tasted a little dry to me and in all honesty, the cheesesteak I had earlier that week at the Phillies game was MUCH better. 
So go there just to say you have. Eat a cheesesteak, pick your favorite of the two. Then go find some other place with better cheesesteaks and go there.

Felt like shat afterwards, needless to say. 

Here's my review of Pat's below along with three other famous spots (ordered wiz wit at all spots except at Pat's:

Pat's: Right down the street from Geno's, we actually ordered the Provolone here but wished I would've tried the wiz.  The bread here was much better and meat to onion to bread ratio was perfect.

Geno's: The ordering process was pretty quick.  Meat was most flavorful according to others in our group. My only complaint but a major one would be the bread.  It was pretty chewy. That pretty much ruined the sandwich experience there for me. 

Tony Luke's: The wait here was longer than Pat's and Geno's but worth it.  You get free pickles and sweet peppers here which is pretty cool.  My only complaint is that they don't put in enough onions or else it could have been more flavorful.

Jim's: This place seems to be growing in popularity quickly and I think might be newer out of the four spots.  The line was pretty long but you do get to see how they make the sandwiches right through the glass pane in front.  It was unorganized when I was there, they forgot to give me my order of sweet peppers and over charged me a sandwich while one guy was throwing me attitude on top of it.  The sandwich seemed to be lacking in flavor though.  I know this sounds terrible but it was lacking that old school grease! LOL  Also, check out their upstairs dining area where you can find autographed photos of celebs that have dined there (who is DeMzel Washington?? haha).

1) Pat's
2) Tony Luke's
3) Jim's
4) Geno's

We came on a chilly Wednesday in February and there was no line.  Totally different than my last visit in October when the line was wrapped around the building. 

Stephen liked Geno's who uses sliced meats where Pat's uses chopped meat.  If I had to pick, my vote still remains with Pat's. They also put the cheese on top, which makes their sandwich look fuller.

However, my favorite isn't either one but John's Roast Pork, which is our next stop on the tour of Philly.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Alright my fans, so I trecked up to Philly, been wanting to do this for a long time now.  Finally did it.  If you live on the East coast and live within 3 hours of Philly, then you have to do the Pat/Geno challenge, or you're just UnAmerican and you SUCK, if you Do have it on your itenerary of things to do, then you're not UnAmerican and you don't SUCK.

So I finally went there and I tried Geno's first.  Since they're right across the street from one another, you have to pick one.  I picked Geno's first because they made it look like Chucky Cheese with all the bright colors and lights, the adult child in me got suckered by the colors and lights.  

And if you're not a native and you go there and try one for the first time ever and you don't try the other, then you're just a wierdo.  

I'm not a wierdo and I wanted to know what all the hype is about, so I tried both.

I sacrificed my caloric/sodium intake just for you, my readers.  So if it's your first time there, you know which one to go to first.  Go to PAT's.  Pat's is far superior from Genos.  

I am a cheese steak connoisseur.  It's all about bread and meat, primarily.  And both of those combos are far superior than Genos.  The line for both was out to the middle of the street but the wait was not long.  They have perfected their speed and system.  

Pluses for both places, plenty of napkins that are freely accessible and their hot peppers are the bomb.  

Over all I give Pat's 4 out of 5 and Geno's 1 out of 5.  Geno's was really like 1 step above high school cafeteria cheese steaks, ok maybe that's an exageration, but Pat's is far superior.  

My rookies, try both and you will come to my conclusion.  I have had better subs in both the Oriole and Cardinal states.  But it's good for the experience and conversation piece. 

I have officially become a Pat's fan.  Btw, both places are cash only, kinda shady, I'm just sayin...

ALthough, what is to follow has nothing to do with the food, I don't really appreciate or care for Geno's xenophobic undertones.  For crying out loud, his great/grand parents or whoever, spoke Italian FIRST, English Second!  Someone's inability to speak perfect english does not mean they are not American or not capable to learn perfect english sometime down the road. 

At the end of the day, he's/was a business man and he tried to capatilize and gather attention for his business through the xenophobia that has been/was created through the terrorist attacks and illegal alien issue.

Job well done on seeking attention through xenophobia--job poorly done on making a cheese steak better than your competitor.

This is the original place where Cheesesteaks originated from, and has been open for many decades (since the 1930s). So popular is this place, that it even has a wikipedia entry.

This place is also open 24 hours a day.

The service is very efficient as in they even have a sign showing how to spend less time ordering.

First of you you mention what you would like. That is ""Cheesesteak"". Then you mention the type of cheese. Either ""Provolone"" or ""Cheesewiz"" (I'm a bit addicted to Cheesewiz, but I have to try Provolone sometime). Then you mention if you want onions or not ""wit"" or ""wit out"". So, for example you walk up to the window and say ""Cheesesteak, wiz wit"" (which means you want a cheesesteak with onions and cheesewiz). Then you pay and collect at the next window which comes out almost right away.

I grabbed the Thursday 10:20am Megabus from outside Javits and hit Philly around noonish, having only had coffee and a donut for breakfast. The bus let up off just down the street from Independence Hall, so I checked it and the Liberty Bell out first before heading to 8th Street to catch the 47 bus to Passyunk.  There they both were, Pat's and Geno's, standing opposite each other like two pro wrestlers waiting to take each other apart. Being a purist, I hit Pat's first. I've heard horror stories about mile-long lines, but being that this was 1:30pm on a Thursday, there was only one person ahead of me and being that I don't mix milchdik & fleishdik, I ordered a steak wit (onions) ($10.00 wit tax) and grabbed a green, orange and red cherry pepper as a side.  If you don't know about cherry peppers, here's some advice: The red ones, counter-intuitively, are sweet with a nice little kick of heat. The orange ones are hotter and the green ones, if you can't take the heat, you should avoid. Fortunately, I like heat. They were certainly generous enough with the meat, which, while a bit on the greasy side, was tender and flavorful. The bread was nice and chewy enough to hold up to the meat, but it was obviously very fresh.
Having skipped breakfast and being subjected to a two-hour bus ride and brief historical tour, I still had room after my Pat's steak to try the upstart newcomer, so I dodged traffic and headed across the street to Geno's, where I ordered the same steak with onions and no cheese  (also $10.00 wit tax). Unlike Pat's, where they slice and chop their meat, Geno's slices and grills, which may be why their meat, in comparison was so dry and tasteless. The difference between Pat's and Geno's was so obvious that I dodged traffic a second time and bought two more to take back to Brooklyn ""wit"" me. In my humble opinion, in the war between Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's, Pat's wins hands-down.

However, one day, while driving down to Maryland, I was faced with a difficult decision.  On one hand, my beloved Geno's had a massive line that would have taken about 45 minutes to get through.  On the other hand, Pat's stood across the street, with no line at all.

Despite the tough decision, I ended up deciding to give Pat's another shot.  After giving some advice to an out-of-town family on ""how to order a cheesesteak,"" I ordered my own Whiz Without.  Unlike Geno's, Pat's chops their steak up and puts the cheese on top of the meat instead of directly on the roll.  
Unfortunately, this makes the cheesesteak suffer, given that the cheese gets cold quicker and does not stay in liquid format as easily.

While the roll is good and very similar to the ones used at Geno's, I prefer the meat at Geno's, which has a little more fat on it, making it juicier.  I also prefer the slabs of thinly sliced steak, rather than the chopped up steak that Pat's uses.

Although the size of the line can vary, it is usually pretty easy to find parking nearby.  As the originator of the cheesesteak, I will give it credit for inventing one of my favorite foods.  However, their current name takes it a bit far, suggesting being the King of Steaks, which currently should rightfully belong to its cross-street rival, the neon-lighted Geno's.  Nevertheless, this cheesesteak is above average, just not when compared to other Philly locales.

Pat's has a similar set up like Geno's.........you go to the ordering counter, & order your sandwich. Please note the ordering sign, as they have instructions on how to order your sandwich to keep the line moving. 
Upon getting your sandwich, there are a few outdoor tables & seats, as this place is basically a grab & go kinda place too.

Upon ordering my sandwich, I got my cheesesteak with onions and American cheese. Just a tip gang.........don't do American cheese..........get the ""Whiz"" instead, as that's the true way to eat a cheesesteak sandwich. 
I guess I'm not a fan of cheese whiz, and that is why I did the American cheese..........but the American cheese didn't really go too good in the sandwich..............so get da Whiz! No can go wrong!

I liked the fact that Pat's cuts up their meats for their sandwiches...........as the meat tasted less chewy than Geno's, but overall..........it was just okay for me as I've had better at other places.

Loved the history about this place, as Pat's King of Steaks is well know in Philly.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Hubby went for steak, provolone and onions, same verdict, pretty good. Fries were good and fresh.

What cost them points:
1 - I appreciate that they try to put out this ""neighborhood joint"" vibe by having their own ordering language that they thoughtfully post instructions to where you wait in line and explaining that if you mess up you will have to go to the back of the line and try again. Really? It didn't matter when we were there because there was no one else in line, but I messed up my order. I'd have been pretty bent out of shape if you made me go to the back of any line because I couldn't properly recite your strange lingo.
2 - After the above-mentioned stringent requirement that you hustle and don't waste THEIR time when we moved on to the pick up window the employees were busy playing grab-@$$ with each other instead of getting our fries and drinks for us. Double standard much guys?

Anyway, it was still a decent meal and now that I've checked it off the list next time I'll probably take the advice of family that lives in Philly ""Just go into any little old neighborhood place that advertises steaks and you will get a better sandwich, at a better price.""","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The steak were chopped, tender and flavorful.  The grilled onions were cooked just right.  The whiz was thick and oozing.  The bread was warmed by the meat filling and never gotten soggy from the Whiz.  Every bite was heaven and the cheesesteak warmed me up from the windy cold weather.

Forks are for wimps when it comes to the cheese fries.  The fries were drenched with Whiz and it was finger licking good.

Geno's cheese steaks are 50 cents more but nothing comparably to Pat's.  Pat's cheese steaks were longer and heavier.  I want my bang for the buck.

- CASH ONLY: be sure to bring cash.

It must be the out of towners that have never had a cheesesteak.  If that's the case, then yes, the cheesesteak sandwich in general is an outstanding work of art.  However, Pats or Genos for that matter, are not even close to the best in the city.

The one thing I will give them is they are open late (24 hours), so if you've been out drinking and partying, this cheesesteak at 4AM will taste awesome.  However, if you are sober and looking for quality, look elsewhere.  The atmosphere is classic South Philly, I'll give them that.  However, the sandwich is overall sub-par.

In my opinion, the best cheesesteak in the city belongs to John's Roast Pork, in fact, they may have 2 or 3 of the best sandwiches in the city.  Their cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak, roast pork and new roast beef are all dynamite.  Don't waste your time with Pats or Genos, head down to Johns Roast Pork.

Everyone is right, cheese steaks just don't taste the same anywhere else. I'm thinking it's the bread. Their bread is very distinctive.

I like that they provide cherry peppers as a condiment. You don't find that at many places (at least in Chicago, because Chicagoans can't get enough of fatty giardinera).

The bread:
-- Bread from Pat's was way too tough/. Not only did I have to bite into the bread, but I had to literally tear the bread in order to take any bites. The bread from Geno's was way easier to tolerate.

The steak:
-- The portion of meat from Geno's was much smaller than Pat's. Also, the meat from Pat's was much more seasoned. I'm not sure if Geno's seasons their meat with anything 'cause it basically tasted like unseasoned roast beef. 

The filling:
-- I got Whiz With (with cheese whiz and with onions) at both places. I liked Geno's onions better, but the whiz was better from Pat's since Geno's was very skimpy on the whiz. The whiz is easily visible on the Pat's cheesesteak, but Geno's put a VERY TINY amount at the bottom of their cheesesteak. I almost went back to ask if they had forgotten to put it on.

The price:
-- It's same at both places. $8.25 for cheesesteak.  ***CASH ONLY***

Service:
-- Service at both locations sucked big time. I guess it's part of the whole ""lure"" to be rude and even curse at the customers. But I am not into this whole dumb idea of  ""Hahhahaa. I just got cursed at at a tourist trap. I can't wait to post it on Facebook and Twitter!""  I still expect people to be nice, especially people who are servicing customers.

Personally, both places sucked. The food wasn't all that bad but it wasn't anything close to what I was expecting. I expected more flavor, more meat, more cheese, and most importantly, more taste.  

It's cool to check out if you are a tourist. Geno's totally had the look of seedy old Las Vegas decor going on.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Hands down.

That being said, my most recent trip to Pat's was not as memorable as my first trip, now that I have had a fair bit of experience in the wide world of cheesesteaks.

Don't get me wrong, you gotta give respect where respect is due! 
Pat's is the originator, right? Pat's is the standard by which all other cheesesteaks should be held. And it is the best place for every ""beginner"" to start. You will probably find better steaks in other places in the city, but this one is guaranteed to still be damn good and give you a starting point for what to expect when you're talking cheesesteak.

""Whiz wit"" is the only way to go. Actually, scratch that; I have never tried American at Pat's (so I can't say for sure), but whiz is so much better than provolone, that I cannot imagine a better alternative. But in my opinion, no matter what, you HAVE to get it ""wit"" onions. Delicious.

Not only does the STYLE of the cheesesteak at Pat's create an important compass for the cheesesteak virgin, but it also is the process of ordering that is a necessary experience. The workers are still the real deal, unphased by hype or tourism. They're just there to crank out the steaks.

My biggest ""dropped star"" in this review is the price. I don't MIND paying $9.50 for a cheesesteak, but maybe because just a couple days before, I got a better cheesesteak for almost half the price, I have become slightly embittered. It's not that I don't love Pat's, or that I can't pay the price, I just can't see myself needing to come back here again after finding more fortunate chartered waters elsewhere. 
But I can't imagine a more deserving place for me to write my 100th Yelp review.

We got a sandwich from each. There is a night and day difference in the sandwich the line and the staff. Geno's has a much shorter line about half the size but its employees are tremendously nice and courteous. The sandwich wasn't as good nor did it have the same amount of meat and cheese as Pat's. The Pat's line is much longer than Geno's and it moves really slowly while Gino's lines moves really quickly they have someone doing each job. The staff are just rude I guess I could say that's kind of typical for Philadelphia a place that throws snowballs and boo Santa and their sports teams constantly.

The VIBE: 1.5 Stars (Pat's) and 3 Stars (Geno's) - The weather was overcast, so I'm guessing sunny weather would have made the covered patio seating (although extremely old and uncomfortable tables/benches) more appealing.  Geno's has a slightly fancier and cleaner vibe, but nothing special.

The SERVICE: 2.5 Stars - Obviously it's Philly and these places are kind of legendary tourist spots that aren't desperate for my business.  Nonetheless, I was still surprised at the rudeness since I stood out of line and patiently researched beforehand in order to not ask ""rookie"" questions.  The food was ready very quickly, almost too quick for me to question the freshness.

The FOOD:  2.5 Stars (Pat's) and 2 Stars (Geno's) - Obviously both were underwhelming.  Pat's had the slight edge because I liked the Provolone instead of the CheezWhiz but in both cases, the meat was drier than expected and the bread didn't seem fresh.

The sad thing is i can get better more consistant cheesesteaks at the mall I live near, which serves them consistently hot and with better cheeses.

I went to Pat's second of the two, yes I was drawn to all the pretty colors at Genos and after eating there I figured out why they were needed to attract business.

Pat's service is mixed, the interactions with their staff and reading some of there signs can be taken as witty or rude. I guess you just need to have a sense of humor to enjoy their customer service, and afterall people are coming there for a show, i just dont know if they figured out comedy isn't their specialty.

It was good, was it worth $9, no, I'd say a fiver would be fair, maybe a six if you throw them a buck for the poor comedy routines. 

Its a slight improvemet over Wawa, but hey if your main compeition is Geno's I can see the lack of motivation to truly be the king of steaks.

First, we sampled Pat's. Word to the wise: Pat's and Geno's are literally right across the street from each other. So you might as well try both if you're in the area.

I prefer Pat's cheese steak to Geno's, and here's why:
- The beef is thinly chopped. Not particular flavorful, but that's okay b/c the cheese whiz is where the real flavor is. 
- The onions are finely sliced, and you can barely tell they're in the sandwich. This gives the cheese steak a very subtle onion flavor, and quite the opposite of the ""in y0 face"" onion taste you'll find at Geno's. 
- Cheese Whiz is very cheesy. It's almost too sharp and over-powering. And, I almost wish that I had sampled the provolone instead. 
- The hoagie bread is longer and toastier on the outside, and softer on the inside than Geno's. 
- Less about marketing. Look at Geno's, and that flashing billboard makes you at first wonder if it's a strip club that actually belongs in Reno, NV. There are photos of celebrities everywhere posing with Joey Vento (RIP) and even the sandwich wrappers say Geno's ""the best"" 

All in all, it was a fun experience. The cheesesteak was good, but not something I would crave. I could definitely tell that Pat's and Geno's are targeted towards tourists and have been thriving on reputation for a long time. The cheesesteak was good, but nothing mind-blowing. And, compared to cheesesteaks I've had in California (yes-- I just did go there), there wasn't any distinction as to why one should come to Philly for the cheesesteak.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I also didn't like that they only take cash, which is a bit inconvenient for some people, but thankfully there was a place across the street with an ATM.

A little after 2 am on a Friday morning, my husband, our little girl dog and I decided to check out this place after eating half of our cheesesteak at Geno's. If you come here, I guess you might as well try both and see which you may like better. But I also highly recommend that you check out other cheesesteaks that are in this city to give you a better comparison on what is all the fuss about these sandwiches. 

Just like Geno's, this place is open 24 hours and is CASH ONLY. They also have outdoor, dog friendly seating. 

We ended up ordering: Steak With American Cheese, $10 after tax- The meat here is chopped instead of sliced at Geno's. Also the meat is seasoned, which to me is already a step up from Geno's. But they serve the onions raw (I prefer mine cooked) and Geno's cooks their onions. The  Italian roll used was pretty good but I thought this cheesesteak was average too. 

Please note that there is a sign that says to have your order ready when you get to the window. If you don't you should go back in line until you are ready. It isn't that hard to figure that out. Just let the employee know if you want onions, the type of sandwich and what kind of cheese. And wait for your order at the window. 

After the guy made his order, he left and sat down with his friend at a small table. The lady had his sandwich ready and seemed rather annoyed that he didn't pick it up. She just left it at the counter while we ordered at the window. We got our sandwich right away and eventually, that guy got up and got his sandwich. 

In the Rocky Movie, if you recall, the loan shark, Tony Gazzo brought Rocky to grab a bite to eat at Pat's. There is a plaque that is placed exactly where that happened, in case you movie buffs wanted to know that (and am sure you are also aware of the Rocky Statue and the steps from the movie he ran up at the Philadelphia Museum of Art). That is kind of neat to see while you are here. 

Overall, we were rather disappointed with both sandwiches from Pat's & Geno's.

We ate at Pat's first, got one with provolone and one with ""whiz.""  Surprisingly, the whiz was actually better than provolone.  Overall, though, both sandwiches were completely mediocre.  The bread was unremarkable, the meat was tough and flavorless.  The fries were quite soggy.  I was very pumped for this, so the experience was a huge letdown.  

With lowered expectations, we next ventured to Geno's.  My wife and I opted to just split a sandwich with ""whiz.""  Geno's was slightly better, mostly due to somewhat more flavorful steak.  Otherwise, the experience was almost identical.  The steak is cut a bit thicker at Geno's, but the sandwich is similarly mediocre.  

Sad fact: I have had better Philly Cheesesteaks at Texadelphia in Texas.  Also, Silver Dinner in Maryland has better cheesesteaks.  

Side note:  While at Geno's, they were filming an interview with a guy who was presumably the owner/manager.  My wife and I were sitting behind him, likely on camera.

Okay, people will say, its because I didn't get cheese wiz, or because I didn't slather it in hot sauce, or a myriad of other excuses. But at the end of the day, I was saddened because I expected a life changing experience. What I got was something very average. Although I will admit I will definitely try it again (and maybe go to Jim's) 

The meat was very average. I didn't taste any variety of special spices or sauces that its cooked in, just average ground steak pieces. The cheese probably didn't help - I'd say skip provolone because it doesn't add much flavor. The greasy onions just provided some texture, but had obviously been cooking so long on the grill that they had lost all the aroma they could have added to the meats. The bread, on the bright side, was fresh and pretty good, but alas, could not make up for everything else.

What do I wish? I wish I could have had butter spread on the bread. I wish the meat had been seasoned. I wish I had gotten cheese wiz. I wish a bunch of things. But most of all, I wish it would have delivered or at least tried to deliver the high expectations I had for it.

Upon taking a bite into the sandwich, we both made a face. This was inedible. The meat was really chewy - like chewy to the point I couldn't actually rip through it and spit it out. It lingered in my teeth annoyingly until I got back home two hours later to floss it out. The cheese wasn't melted, the onions were barely there, and the meat was disgusting with way too much fat. But, I wanted to use the 10 dollar sandwiches, so I brought it home to my dogs. My basset hound actually wouldn't eat it, and stared at it for about 10 minutes before the fat corgi tried to steal it from her, in which she ate in one gulp out of fear for losing it.

The one thing I really enjoyed about this place over Geno's was their meat, it was more tender and flavorful than Geno's but they could use some better bread.  I think if they took the bread from over at Geno's then they'd put Geno's out of business over time with their quality.

I wouldn't return here in the future, I've had my side by side comparison and satisfied my earning to see what the buzz was/is all about so my experience is complete.

Everything here is ala carte as well, you gotta buy your cheese steak apart from your fries.  It's all cash too so at the end of the day for a combo meal you're paying more than $20 for fast food which is ridiculous.

Overall, I was a bit overwhelmed.  I have been to Jim's about a million times and I was never overwhelmed.  I was with my cousin who frequents both Pat's and Genos.  Apparently out of the two, Pat's was the one who ""cut up the meat"" like I like it, more like shredded.  Eh.  It was not really shredded compared to my Philly Phave, Jim's.  It was more like large slices of beef.  The roll, of course, was amazing.  The provolone cheese was not melted, it was literally just placed on the roll, they put the meat on and hand it to you... eh.  The onions were somewhat cold too, like they were cooked, moved to the side of the grill and they took the ones on top that had time to chill.  Eh.

It did not disappoint with the amount of grease though =) The experience is what you have to go here for but I don't see an immediate repeat in my near future.  

The thing that struck me by surprise was the steps to order a cheesesteak.  Who knew?  I know you order what you want but I didn't know there was a specific order to do so.

Well, if you paid attention the first time I wouldn't have to continue to say what I want. So service was terrible. We did get our food quick considering we had about 20 people or so in our party so that wasn't bad. The food itself? Eh. Living in CT, I've had wayyyyy better Philly cheese steaks.

Well I have had both countless times and decided on my last trip back east to give each a try.

Once you get sixty miles away from Philly, a cheesesteak is hardly a cheesesteak and it is rarely ever duplicated in Virginia, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, or Minnesota.  I have tried numerous places (I actually hit rock bottom when I went to a Subway for theirs and it was total garbage).

What makes Pat's (and Geno's) are several things.  First is the bun which is made from a local Philadelphia bakery and is tasteful and fresh.  Second is the beef they use which is top quality.  Third is the cheese wiz and onions and you top it with catsup.

The place (well the kitchen area) is very clean and the food is sanitary and of high quality.  The line moves very quick and even if you have to stand in line awhile, it is well worth it.

Many reviewers get it right when they say that you cannot tell the difference between Pat's and Geno's.  But I prefer Pat's for one simple reason.  It was the first place I tried on the Triangle and it never let me down.

This was my third visit to Philadelphia and my first time trying Pat's. I usually go with Geno's, but this time I decided to try Pat's to see how the two compare.

It's not even close. I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz without onions (a whiz without). It might not have had the chunks of onions the cheesesteaks with onions have, but there was definitely a strong taste of onions in the meat. It was vile. Apparently, they don't use separate grills or clean the grills very well. When I say without, I mean WITHOUT! The quality of meat and bread was also subpar to Geno's. 

I also got an order of cheese fries. Again, they were incredibly lackluster compared to Geno's. They give you almost half the amount of fries as Geno's and the quality is not nearly as good.

If all of that wasn't enough, their prices are also $1.00 higher than Geno's! It was $11.00 instead of $10.00 for the cheesesteak and $6.00 instead of $5.00 for the cheese fries. Now, I typically wouldn't blink an eye at a dollar, but it makes a big deal when I'm paying more for a lot less quality.

[Anyone who has read my previous review for Geno's Steaks already knows how this ends up].

Service at both venues was surprisingly quick.  In under 10 - 15 seconds, you're ready to chow-down on a hot cheesesteak sandwich.  Both places are about equal in price, Geno's being only slightly more expensive by under a dollar margin [$0.00 - 0.99].  

As far as taste goes, Geno's steak is more tender and the bread is fresher and tastier overall.  Pat's gives you more steak, but the bread is a bit tough and when left plain [non-cheesesteak] the steak is bland.

I get the novelty of just meat cheese and onions and ""ordering properly"" but some customization would be nice. However I did order my sandwich ""togo"" but it wasn't wrapped or in a bag...once I saw some people with bags I decided to go back..get a bag and some extra papers and wrap up my own sandwich.

I know this through no empirical evidence nor intellectual enterprise. In fact, I have never once tried a Gino's Cheesesteak, but I have been raised on the principle that the Irish know far more about how to slop red meat and cheese whiz on fresh bread than the Italians do. 

I believe Pat's is better than Gino's because Father Chuck told me it was true, and Father Chuck, at the time, was the finest man I had ever met. And like the Catholic upbringing that introduced me to 12 years of Parochial schooling, faith in Pat's is better left untested. So here's a story that might raise a few eyebrows: a young and handsome Catholic priest decides to reward some high school kids for volunteering at a soup kitchen, packs the little angels into the back of his mini van, and begins speeding down the Schuykill Expressway to an almost abandoned looking spot in Southeast Philly save for two long lines of zombies waiting for their fix of the good stuff. The children are then subjected to a flurry of curse words, grill-burnt hands, dead animals, and a meal that's so damned greasy and filling, they'll soon find themselves unconscious for the entirety of the car ride back home. 

This all as a result of Father asking us if we've ever had a Philadelphia cheesesteak. When the answer was a unilateral no, he feigned offense. ""May the Lord forgive your neglectful parents."" He then set forth some ground rules, I still live by:

1. Beware the Philadelphia Cheesesteak moniker: if you're in Philadelphia and you're eating a cheesesteak, the odds are it will be good. If you're at a place in the suburbs or another state that serves ""Philadelphia cheesesteaks"", it is a lie deserving of a flipped table in the hall of the Pharisees.

2. You can get all kinds of fancy and wonderful cheesesteaks in the city, but if you're at Pat's, you go traditional and get the whiz. It's gross, of course, but tradition is tradition. If we can handle transubstantiation each Sunday, I think we can handle a little whiz.

3. Finally, as we already determined: Pat's is better than Gino's. No reason. Just canonical truth. 

Father Chuck proved to not only a good priest in a world full of monsters, he was the best of all role models. During my high school years, Father taught me how to swear in three languages, drive like an absolute maniac, and to believe that good deeds really do matter to God. Above all else, Father Chuck taught us to memorize our cheesesteak order before walking up to the counter or risk a brutal verbal assault from the staff behind the counter.   

The ephemeral Catholic Church of Father Chuck's world was one where giving back was cool. Father Chuck was cool, so serving the homeless at a soup kitchen and playing piano at a children's hospital was most certainly cool. I truly loved the man and the life he seemed to live. I think Father Chuck could tell that and finally sat me down and asked if I had considered the priesthood. After a few hours discussing more about the vocation, I took his advice and spent a weekend at Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary. As an awkward teen already living a life of forced celibacy, the priesthood didn't seem so bad. Sure, you'd have to wear itchy clothes and say a lot of masses, but you could always pack up and head down to Philly and eat that incredibly flavorful steak on freshly baked bread.

As you can probably tell by my other reviews filled with incessant swearing and talks of orgies, poop, and violence, I did not become a priest. I also only went back to Pat's Steaks on one other occasion. I was with my then friend, Kaitlyn. All was going well until Kaitlyn brought along a blind date to tag along with us to Pat's. To my memory, the young man was awkward and sweet, though I can't for the life of me remember his name. What I do remember is the poor bastard stuttered his order and was immediately called a ""fucking moron,"" by two of the grill cooks hoping to move the line. I of course came prepared and had my order memorized, and Kaitlyn and I were married five years later. So what's the message here? Go to Pat's Steaks, and trust your heroes when they say they can lead you on a path towards a lifelong vocation. Perhaps some day they will.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I went to this place with a friend from Cherry Hill, New Jersey a while ago, and he said to me that this is something that every tourist to Philadelphia should experience, and it was recommended by another friend who is originally from Ambler. This is the first cheesesteak place I have been to in Philadelphia. While I would not visit this place often if I was ever a resident of this interesting city, I found the Cheesesteak here to be tastily adequate.

I ordered a Cheesesteak with Cheez Whiz as the cheese, which is a processed cheese sauce. My friend got the same thing, and we shared a cup of fries. The steak itself was chopped up bits of meat, probably would have tasted really mediocre if it was not for the Cheez Whiz which made it tastier. I found the bread probably a few steps above mediocre. I thought it was a tad dry, but the grease from the beef made the bread really soft, chewy and flavorful. 

As for the fries, they were pretty tasty with the right amount of salt, and the texture had the right amount of crisp that made the fries almost addicting to eat. 

Despite eating a somewhat tasty cheesesteak, I think it is a little pricey, since I paid almost $8 for the cheesesteak. Fries are almost $3. I think it's because this place has got so famous that it is slowly becoming really touristy. Service is extremely effective. As long as you read the rules sign while you stand in line, you can get your food in a few minutes after you order. Since we were eating on the tables outside, a few flies came in and irritated us, so they definitely need to figure out a way to prevent insects from coming in. A great advantage is that this place is open 24 hours so it is not a bad choice for food after a night out in the city.

Overall, this is not a bad place to get a somewhat tasty cheesesteak and fries. I know that there are better cheesesteak places in this interesting city, and I am still in the hunt for best Cheesesteak in Philly.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Anyway, the whole cheesesteak thing started with Pat's in the 1930's, so we included the comparison on our trip, thinking of Pat's as our baseline.

First of all, it's an assembly line...took us about 30 seconds to get a sandwich in a crowded city block.  Roll, meat, fried onions, whiz, wrap and done.  Seemed kinda institutional.

However, the taste was better than expected.  We were warned that there are better tasting steaks in town, which is true, but this ""touristy"" experience was still pretty good.  The meat was seasoned well, the roll was nicely chewy and the whiz just tied it all together.  But much like the Anchor Bar in Buffalo (originator of buffalo wings), there have been improvements to the original.

You will need to a buy a onion, a nice soft bakery sub roll, a bottle of cheese whiz and some steak 'umm (or shaved beef from the meat counter if available). Dice and sautee the onions and then cook the steak. Cut the bread. Heat the wiz. Spread the Wiz on the roll then add steak and onion. 

TaDa! You've just created a cheesesteak BETTER then both Geno's and Pat's!

If you must go then save the $9 bucks you'd spend at Geno's and buy two from Pat's!

The sandwich here at least looks like a bit more thought was put behind it, it comes out looking a heck of a lot better than Genos. There is more meat,  more appetizing grilled onions. Softer bread. Taste wise, it could use some tang, like come jalapenos or something.

ATMOSPHERE:
We must've stepped on dog poop because we luckily found parking right across the street from the restaurant.  As we pulled in, I saw the line that spilled out onto the street.  I was thinking hell no, forget it.  But you know what?  The line moves pretty darn quick, so just do it!  Hordes of cars kept coming and coming with the line at Pat's and Geno's taking turns ebbing and flowing.  Everyone entertained themselves while waiting to get to the ordering window, especially in selfies with the neon biz sign.  Once you near the ordering window is when you'll see the menu and ""how to order"" signs.  The first window handles strictly sandwich orders.  If you want sides or drinks, you order and pay again at the second window.  Picnic table-style seating wraps around the fluorescent-lit covered lanai.  There are no restrooms or place to wash your hands.  Napkin dispensers are readily available to mop up the messy job at hand.
 
MENU:
Steak sandwiches in 13 varieties, roast pork, hot dog, fish cake, fries in 4 varieties.  Water, soda, coffee, tea, cocoa.
 
3-STEP ORDERING:
It's beneficial to know what you want by the time you get to the window as things move swiftly.  Step 1: Choose your sandwich.  Step 2: Say ""wit"" AKA ""with"" if you want grilled onions in your sandwich.  Step 3: Order your cheese type (cheese whiz is the liquid stuff, provolone or American).
 
FOOD:
Mushroom Cheese Steak - $11.04
I got mine wit (onions) and cheese whiz.  The odd price is so that the total rounds up to an even amount with tax.  No time to deal with change here.  Does it live up to the hype?  I say, sure.  I'm not a cheesesteak aficionado but I thought it was good.  The bread was soft, the rough-chopped steak tender and flavorful with the liquid cheese adding more savory notes and the fresh mushrooms a nice earthy flavor.  It's quite a large sandwich, probably close to a footlong but I finished it!  Had I taken time to read the menu better, I would've ordered the sandwich with peppers too. 
 
SERVICE:
It was a chaotic, comical mess but in an organized way LOL.  I've never paid for and received food so quick in my life, literally within 20 seconds.  The guy taking orders was cool, even double checking that I really wanted onions and mushrooms on my sandwich.  I added on sodas but was told it's ordered at the next window.  Wham, bam, thank you ma'am!
 
TIPS:
Cash only.
 
Open 24/7.

That being said, they were still curt with my group, but it was like getting slapped around by a sibling-- do you forgive them immediately? Yes. Welcome to Philly, tourists.

The family was all waiting for my daughter and I at Pat's, while we were at Geno's. 

I'll start with first impressions: My daughter desperately needed to use the rest room and Pat's told her to go over to the park adjacent from them!  We did and there was no rest room!  Geno's was right there, so we asked them and they slipped her into the back and left her piddle.

Now we get to friendliness, cleanliness and decor.  Pat's is old and dirty and has not spent one dime of their profits to stand out in these three fields.  Geno's on the other hand has put a lot into these areas.

Now for the cheesesteaks:  Even though we were all headed to Pat's, my daughter and I were so impressed with Geno's that we ordered our steak and fries there. The other 5 in our party stayed at Pat's. 

My daughter and I took our order from Geno's over to Pat's to eat with the others ( tacky for sure and I would have rather ate at Geno's because of the cleanliness and decor). 

First of all, to order a sandwich and fries at Geno's, you must order them and pay for them separately at two different windows,  I can see where this works for them at busy times, but we were the only ones there.  

The meat at Geno's is much, much better than at Pat's.  Everyone, but my stubborn son in law agreed.  The bread is better at Pat's.  The onions are raw at Geno's and sauteed at Pat's.  With a grilled sandwich I would have preferred the sauteed, but I did order a cheesesteak hoagie, so that may be the reason. 

Pat's uses more cheese.  I had provolone. 

All in all, if you add it all up, Geno's definitely has the better of the two cheesesteaks and wins hands down for decor, cleanliness and friendliness.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

We tried Pat's instead of Geno's due to the latter's xenophobic publicity in the past.
Haven't heard of the people of Pat's being xenophobic assholes, but the person who took our order when we were there (a Saturday night) was at the least a regular asshole.  

They have obnoxious instructions hanging on the wall that explain how they expect you to order your sandwich.  They are very clear that if you screw up the way they want you to order, they'll send you to the end of the line.

I found this to be off-putting but really got the full experience when I got to the order window.  The employee was purposefully obnoxious--either seeming to go along w/ the all business//wit or witout//whaddayawant routine or, in my opinion, just using that as an excuse to get his own rocks off via  a little cheesesteak order line power trip. It was pathetic.  As soon as I said what I wanted he loudly and rudely corrected what I had said by spitting it out in the Pat's code.  When I asked if he recommended cheese whiz or provolone cheese, he screamed ""WHATEVER YOU WANT!"".  When I was done ordering the sandwich, he told me to move along.  I asked if I could order a drink as well and he screamed ""YOU DON'T DO THAT HERE!.......IN THE OTHER WINDOW!"".
It was disgusting.  All I could think was what a loser this cheesesteak order window bully was.  

I've seen others describe the all business/high-stress ordering scenario with stars in their eyes as if it's part of the fun.  Those people are cooked.  Always thought it and it was confirmed when I got to experience it first-hand.  Made me regret giving them my $$ before I even got my mediocre cheesesteak.

The cheesesteak was OK.  Not terribly upsetting, but not the best in Phila.  Ehh.  I'd give the cheesesteak a 7.1/10.0.  I'd give the service and non-eating experience a 0/10.0.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Overall, no easy way to put this...But the roasted pork on a hero roll was one of the worst tasting foods I have ever put in my mouth...Or should I say the most tasteless thing I have probably ever eaten. The only positive, if it was a positive was that it wasn't bathed in grease like the beef cheese steaks. The hero roll itself was tasteless and obviously made 1-2 days earlier in some mass production bakery. The roasted pork or what they claimed was roasted pork could better be described as a non-beef steak-umm. It had NO taste whatsoever.

Final review I'm planning on writing on my Wilmington/Philly Memorial Day weekend trip.  Although I thought of another business I may write a review of in Philly.

Prior to May 2018 trip, I had visited Philly in March 2015, and a friend had recommended Jim's Cheesesteaks on South Street over Pat or Geno's.  I was not a fan of Jim's, which I may write a review on Jim's too if I get around to it.

I did some research into Pat's & Geno's.  I had told my Philly native friend, who lives in the DC area now, that I was thinking one friend could go to one and the other go to the other, and we split the sandwiches, but that would've been a hassle if we had done that.  She strongly recommended Pat's over Geno's criticizing a national news story regarding Geno's.  I didn't really like it either; not enough to boycott but something I took into consideration.  Plus, the reviews were a little better for Pat's.  

Also, when I walked by both, I couldn't even find prices for Geno's, which bothered me.  The prices for Pat's were clearly listed, and while expensive by cheesesteak standards, at least the prices were clearly shown.  Also, Geno's seemed dirtier to me.  

Additionally and perhaps most importantly, there was a historical marker plaque for Pat's saying that the cheesesteak was invited here in 1930.  There was no plaque for Geno's.  This confirmed my decision to go with Pat's. 

EXPERIENCE & FOOD:

My two friends & I waited in line, which was out to the street.  My friend joked we were going to get run over waiting for a cheesesteak, and I further joked that it would be worth it for an excellent authentic cheesesteak.  A guy behind us in line chimed in joking, 'Don't you know? That's how they get their meat!  From the people getting run over.'  I laughed although cannibalism is no laughing matter.

I mentioned to my friends, you may cash, right?  Because this place is cash only.  They both said they had cash.  The guy in front of me in line asked me, 'It's cash only?'  I confirmed it is.  He think he went to the ATM while his g/f or friend he was with held his spot.

The line moved fairly quickly.  Looked like it could've been a 30 minute wait, but it was more like 15 minutes.  We get to the front, and they are very strict about how you order the sandwich.  I said Philly cheesesteak 'Witout Onions' first.  I paid the $11.  They got me the sandwich right away, and simultaneously, I realized I didn't mention the type of cheese I wanted, which I mentioned.  The guy rudely said, ""You get cheese whiz; next!""  For the record, I would've gotten provolone, but I was ok with the cheese whiz.  

Something unique was that you ordered the sandwich first and then you went to the second line to get miscellaneous things like drinks, fries, etc.  I figured the sandwich was big, and I didn't need fries.  Also, didn't want to spend $4.50 on a soda I didn't need.  I had already spent $11.

Both my friends got $4.50 soda.  I asked my friend if he could ask for a water cup for me.  I observed them say they didn't have a water cup.  I had a feeling they were going to say that.  Normally, I would be boycotting a place that didn't give a water cup (See my 1-star Popeyes review on 409 8th St SE, Washington DC as an example of that), but I let it slide in this very rare instance because this place was an institution of cheesesteak in Philly.

The Philly cheesesteak was far superior to Jim's, and it was so delicious.  It was unlike any cheesesteak I've had before in my life.  There are maybe 2 or 3 in the DC-Baltimore area that are about equally as good in taste.  But something in the flavor of the meat was really quite amazing with Pat's.  Also, I really liked the Cheese Whiz.

SUMMARY & WATER CONCLUSIONS:
Taste of the food is 5-stars.  Brash customer service & no water cup knocks it down a star to 4-stars.  Overall, I would give this another try since the sandwich was so good.  

Also, after I ate my sandwich, we popped in a convenience store since I was very thirsty.  I paid $0.75 for a bottled water in a convenience store 1 block away.  I had my friends guess the cost.  My Delaware resident friend guessed $3, and my Maryland friend guessed $1.  He said that he could tell by reaction in the store that I was happy with the price.  I told them $0.75, and they were like wow that was good.  I politely reminded them they paid $4.50 for their soda while I paid $0.75 for my water.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The way I see it, there are two main groups of haters.  First are a group of  some (not all) people who are elitist cheese steak snob locals that say ""Pat's is touristy and [insert another local shop name here] is so much better.""  And second, are a group of people who are used to their regional cheesesteak styles that may include strange cheeses and newfangled toppings like alfa alfa sprouts and God know what else that do not belong on a true Philadelphia cheesesteak and disappointed with Pat's.  

To the first group I say. Give credit where credit is due.  There's a reason why Pat's has been a Philly staple for almost a 100 years (okay  more like 88 years) and they have lines out to wazoo at all times of day.

To the second group I say; YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED. The authentic Philly cheesesteak on the menu at your local Friday's or hole in the wall sandwich shop is NOT, I repeat, NOT a Philly cheesesteak.  A true Philly cheesesteak should be served on a local hoagie roll (usually Amoroso's) with thin juicy slices of season ribeye steak, sauteed onions, and cheese whiz.  That's it.  No mayo, no ketchup, no lettuce, no banana peppers, no hot sauce... No! Just no. Stop it. Saying Geno's is bad because you are used to your local area cheesesteaks is like going to China and saying the food there sucks because you like Panda Express.

First off I've tried both Pat's and Geno's - unless you've completely lost all your taste buds through old age or eating way too much hot sauce - Pat's is the clear winner.

Maybe there are better local places to grab a cheesesteak. But with so many options, if you're from out of town like me and don't know which one to choose you will likely want to at least try one of the two most iconic spots in Philadelphia. Genos or Pats. They are similar, main difference of how their meat is sliced. Genos - sliced, Pats is more chopped , which personally I find to me better and more tender. The provolone is nice and sharp, the cheese wiz - amazing and the peppers have a roasted sweetness that's awesome. The bread is delicious. It was worth the three hour drive, the several block walk in freezing temperatures, the waiting in line of 25 people and eating outside in the cold. Very worth it. In my humble cheesesteak opinion. Best tip: know what you want BEFORE you get to the counter. They serve thousands of those things a day and don't have time for uncertain dawdlers to make up their mind. Use google, read the menu before you get in line or use this review: do you want a steak, a cheesesteak, or peppers and mushrooms  ? What kind of cheese do you want: Wiz (cheesewiz/ liquid cheddar) American, provolone- or all three. And with or without onions. Those are your choices. You order and pay for just the cheesesteaks at the first window and drinks or sodas at the next one. It's not super cheap and it's cash only. Come prepared.

I say that because, prior to getting a cheese steak at Pat's, I always assumed that all of my previous cheese steak experiences were sub par because I had been dealing with sub par cheese steaks.  However, after eating at Pat's--the reported best--I gained the perspective that cheese steaks are what they are, and I'm just not the biggest cheese steak fan in the world.  So the question becomes:  was Pat's really not that good, or was Pat's really good at something I just don't care about.

I  think the answer lies somewhere in the middle.  As my friend Chris R. told me, Pat's cheese steaks are the ones for the tourists and the ones for foodies are located somewhere else.  So, I'm not about to give up on cheese steaks.  Chris also told me that a 3 am Pat's stop should be on the itinerary for a trip to Philly so it wasn't a wasted trip.  Taken as a 3am snack, I think I'd rather just get a waffle at a diner.

All in all, it's just an ok sandwhich.  It's a pretty cool experience though, waiting in line at 3 am with the late night, rowdy crowd where what you're wearing doesn't matter, and the only thing that does is if your doing wiz or american, and wit or witout...i just wish any of those combinations resulted in a 4 star plate.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

For the most part the lines move quickly so don't be worried about a long line. The guys who work there are focused on moving people through.

I have tried the beef, pork, fries and various topping combinations. Some times if I order something that isn't a classic cheese steak the guy I order from is super rude about it. I had a friend who can't eat beef. I got pork and the guy looked at me and said, ""Really? Are you serious?!"" He then clicked his tongue and motioned me along. Other times they are simply professional and trying to get the line moving quickly.

The bread is usually lightly toasted and they give you a decent amount of meat. I would recommend the provolone unless you want to give the classic cheese wiz a shot. They do an alright job and the food is a little better then fast food. As for the fries, I could take it or leave it.

When I say ALL cheesesteak diet, I mean breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snack! (Don't judge me... =\)

After trying Pat's, Jim's, Geno's and Pat's again, by unanimous decision... still!.... king of cheesesteaks!...... ""Pats!...  King of Steaks! since 1930.""

To describe how bombtastic this sandwich is, you gotta imagine the feeling of a hot summer day.... you're looking for a place to cool down, a place to relax and just enjoy yourself, like a nice cool swimming pool. That hot summer day is HUNGER, and that oh so refreshing pool is CHEESE WHIZZ!!!!

Pat's just knows what they're doing ""wit"" the whizzz, it just has the most perfect consistency.  Not too watery, not to thick, but just oh so right....  So good, you can fill a cup with and drink it.  And that's what they did!  They fill a cup with cheese whiz, throw some fries in there, and there you have it.  A cup filled wit whiz or you can call them cheese fries.  But who in their right mind would order that?  Certainly not me.... maybe....  Mmmmm whizzz.....

Besides the oh so great cheese whiz, the steak is just heavenly and those pickled round peppers and crisp chili's are no joke.  Those lil extras take Pat's to a whole nother level.  Those peppers are what makes Pat's.... Pat's!  I couldn't find better from any other place.  

With that said, yes I'm on the Pat's bandwagon, but it's well deserved.  Me and Pat's are one now.... or should I say were one...  Now go get yourself a cheesesteak wit onions and whiz!  Don't get too fancy!

Until next time peoples!

My boyfriend wanted to grab one last cheese steak before heading back home, so we stopped by on a Sunday morning around 10:30a.m. There was still a good couple few eating already, so we each grabbed a sandwich, both with mushrooms, cheese and peppers. 

The food came out super fast which is a pro, but compared to John's Pork Roast Pork (which makes everything to order), the quality didn't cut it. The bread was pretty soggy in some parts of the sandwich, the onions weren't grilled enough to be soft. I did, however, like the peppers at Pat's a lot more. And I loved the huge heap of whole peppers they have on the stand -- spicy but delicious. Overall, the sandwich was a little bland for me and I had to eat a few of those peppers to get through.

Pats and Geno's are a must stop (tourist) destination for any Philly visitor! Pats more so because it is better and the original!

Pats cheesesteaks are about the steak! In terms of proportions of meat to bread, Pats seems to have a nice good amount of steak. This is both a blessing and a curse. 

--- Detailed Review ---

For parking, there is street parking nearby as people come and go from Pats and Geno's. Pats has specific instructions on how to order, which is placed right before the ordering window. Just read and follow instructions. You can practice while you're waiting in line. For example, a cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz would be ""one wiz with."" Pats, like Geno's, is cash only and a normal cheesesteak is (currently) $10. This price range seems to be the norm around Philly.

My favorite part of Pats cheesesteaks is the meat! They put a nice portion on the cheesesteak and it oozes out juices and grease! With this in mind, make sure you eat it over a table, so the juices and grease don't get on your clothes. 

With the large amount of meat, the (soft) bread and onions can fade into the background of the cheesesteak, which some would enjoy. Personally, I wish the onions and bread had a more prominent role. Also, the cheese and onions are put on top of meat/cheesesteak. This allows for a greater visual appeal, but makes it less practical to eat. The onions and melted cheese can easily fall off the sandwich onto your hands, face, table, etc. As stated before, make sure you eat over a table to avoid the drippings getting on your clothes. 

Nonetheless, still a delicious cheesesteak!

Pats is definitely something to try if you're visiting Philly!!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

In terms of the Cheesesteak- It was ok. I certainly wasn't blown away. I loved the bread it was served on. Fresh and tasty. We went with the steak, cheese whiz and onions. Together they made nice combination. However, the meat by itself was a little flavorless. No seasoning what so ever.

As it was my first visit to Philly this summer, how could I not try Pat's & Geno's?  I know it's a tourist trap and the line takes about 15-20mins during weekend lunch hours.

The cheese steaks at Pat's looks appealing, with a huge pile of chopped rib eye beef overflowing out of the roll.  With grease dripping down your hand with each bite, it's a greasy mess to eat.  It requires at least 3 napkins to eat.  I also got a huge chunk of meat that wouldn't break and I almost choked on it.  The tendon wouldn't break so I had to spit it out.

I prefer Geno's just because it seems like the healthier option.  5 out of 5 people in my little road trip agreed.  The flavors were very similar.  They must use the same seasoning (salt & pepper).

Service was unfriendly and we were treated like cattle.  We were rushed to order and they moved onto the next cow.  There is a ridiculous 2nd line for drinks & fries.  However I prefer the fries from Pat's.  They had a good crispy exterior, as if they were thickly battered.  

I got the cheese steak with the provolone cheese & onions.  Food Feuds with Chef Michael Symon from the Food Network came here and they won the giant trophy on the show but only cuz Pat's had whiz on their steak.

One that makes you want to start running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and jumping around in victory like Rocky Balboa.

Yeaaaaaaaaaa.......NO!  I came on a Sunday evening to check out and compare Philly's finest in comfort food.  I realize that nothing could match up to my beloved chicken finger sub but I'm an open minded person when it comes to deciding what would finish in 2nd place.  

Service was shoddy.  Order taker was very nonchalant and disinterested.  I'm a city boy myself so I get it in terms of the blue collar attitude for a blue collar meal but still.....etiquette?

The cheesesteak itself was pathetic in terms of appearance.  It looked haphazardly tossed together, cheese whiz slopped onto it.  Another glaring thing was it was missing.....the rest of the meat!!!  Cheesesteaks are known for being packed with meat are they not?  Did a badger manage to get to mine before it reached my hands?  If I had a voice like the narrator from ""Unsolved Mysteries"" we could sho' nuff figure this thing out. 

Alas, I took my measly little sub and ate.  Meh....meh.......MEH!  It was ok and I'm probably being generous.  Very bland and not very fulfilling.  Relatively inexpensive ($6-$7).  Good thing I had other spots to check out because otherwise I would've left Philly a sad and hungry person.

This is a cash only establishment I believe, so make sure you have cash on hand. You order your cheesesteak from one window and fries/soda from another window. They are 24/7 and we came at like 9:30AM. Haha. 

We ordered a cheesesteak with whiz, onions, and peppers. Side of fries and soda. The cheesesteak was literally done in like 10 seconds, which concerned me since it may be a bit old, but whatever. I already bought it. Fries took about 3-5mins.

Cheesesteak was DELICIOUS!! Not too wet or dry. Had lots of cheese and I love cheese!! I don't think their meats are seasoned, but the cheese and peppers give it flavor. We were shocked on how good it was. They do have pickled hot peppers on the side, which was a great compliment to the cheesesteak. The bread held everything together nicely. The fries were good. Nothing special. I wished they cooked it a bit longer.

Looking at both cheesesteak, initially they look exactly alike, except Pat's seems to be juicier as we unwrap both.

The meat in Pat's was a bit more tender than Gino and definitely more juicy.
Gino was too dry and chewy.  Both buns appears to be the same but with the juices flowing out of Pat's, it made it easier to chew through the buns.

We decided to go back to Pat's for another cheesesteak but with mushrooms and onions($12j, again nice and juicy but the meat seems to be more chewier this time.   The mushroom appears to be like those canned button mushrooms which I really don't care for.

My boyfriend (a non-Philly native and has no loyalty to any steak place) and I wanted to do a side-by-side comparison of the two steaks with the same ingredients: ""Whiz Wit"" (AKA cheese whiz with onions) with ketchup and hot peppers. We came to the conclusion that Geno's was far superior to Pat's. Pat's had an incredibly long line (about a 30-minute wait). The wait for Genos was much quicker, about 10-15 minutes. Pat's had a nice, balanced sandwich (perfect amount of meat to roll to cheese), but found that the bread was slightly stale and fell apart with meat and cheese going everywhere! My first bite was without any ketchup or hot peppers, and the meat was quite bland...and so were the onions. The hot peppers aren't hot at all, and I definitely felt disappointed. But, what do I know? I already have my loyalty to Genos.  My boyfriend did feel similar where he preferred the meat and bun from Genos but liked the balanced sandwich from Pat's since there was definitely more meat and cheese in it. Both sandwiches are $11 and at the end of the day, I would rather have good, less meat than more of it and the sandwich being bland.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

It tasted pretty good at the time.  But, about 30 minutes after I finished eating (as I was driving back to my hotel), I became severely nauseated.  When I arrived at my hotel, I was pretty much ready to pass out - I proceeded to fall asleep for a good three hours.

They gave more meat, cheese was well melted, steak was moist and full of flavor and the bread was nice and soft. Put that all together and you get a fan like me! I highly recommend this place. Both steakhouses are located across the street from one another.

*They only take cash so make sure you bring cash (ATM is located in the area but fee is high) 
*Parking isn't easy, it took us about 20-30mins to find a parking but it was totally worth it.

-A brief recounting of how your gentle correspondent came to eat hot cheesesteak whilest shivering in frigid cold and cursing the gods of weather-

In all my time in San Francisco, I have never lost my absolute contempt for the wimpyness my fellow citizens express at the slightest hint of actual weather.  Temps below 58 degrees, rainfall beyond a slight misting, and even the slightest hint of wind drive people into a Chicken Little-esque panic.  Meanwhile, I've lived places where the high was occasionally -10, and I've watched a tornado make its way through a valley while on horseback, wearing only a t-shirt.  Am I saying I'm better than my neighbors?  Not necessarily.  But maybe.

Right about the time I was sinking my teeth into 6 inches of hot cheesy steak, this attitude was coming back to haunt me.  See, I had accidentally journeyed back into the land of real weather (and real cheesesteak), in the form of Philly in October.  And, apparently, the gods of wind and rain had missed kicking my ass for the last several years, and attempted to make up for it by visiting upon the greater Eastern Seaboard a fall storm of truly epic proportions.  And all I had brought with me was some long sleeve shirts and my rain jacket.  Plenty enough protection for San Francisco winter, but sadly inadequate for a Philly Phall storm.

You simply cannot visit Philly without devouring a cheesesteak or 2 or 12, and so a group of us headed out to the Great Corner, wherein Pat's King of Steak faces off against another cheesesteak legend.  I opted for Pat's, because both restaurants were equally devoid of any kind of real shelter or heat.  It can safely be said that few visitors attacked their cheesesteak and fries with greater ferocity than I, if only because I knew I had to get that cheesesteak up in me before I could escape to the artificial heat of the nearby sports bar.

Lasting impressions: be authentic and go for the Velveeta cheese; fries aren't great; the hot peppers would be more enjoyable if they were sliced rather than served whole; I'm glad the bell peppers were optional, because I'm very allergic and I was nervous.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

First, they do not need any type of over the top promotional decor to attract customers because once you try their cheesesteaks you know who to go to for your next one.

I'll do my best to describe their ""Cheesesteak Wit"". Once you receive the cheesesteak, you can head left to the condiments where you can add hot sauce, ketchup, whatever you want onto it, but I prefer to keep it the way it is because adding anything else would just interfere with the original taste. Once you take a look at the cheesesteak you immediately notice that it IS greasy, oily and full of steak juices. The bread just soaks up all those juices and softens up quickly so you have to dig right into the cheesesteak ASAP. However, the moistened bread goes fantastic with the juicy steak and abundance of cheese they put on it. The bread is not hard, so it's very easy to digest with bites of the steak.

The flavors of soft slices of juicy, hot steak with the cheese wiz are blended so perfectly here. The juices incorporated into the bread make chewing and digestion very easy.

A question that cannot be simple to answer, for everyone has their own choice, and theory as to why...

I wont go into who has the best, because so many like to mention the less popular places that claim them to be more delicious.
  Keeping it between these two spots, there is indeed a bit more life at Geno's, and is clearly more flashy than Pat's; but, in this food feud, it certainly isn't equivalent to a decision one way or another.

  I took the drive from NY, and got there at 3 am, the lines for both Geno's and Pat's were around the corner; At Geno's, the people waiting on the line were more fun and friendly, more outgoing, than those at Pat's.

All that said, X truly marks this treasured spot with the road crossing in the middle of these two steak stands; Both open 24hrs and both drawing their loyal fanatics, Hold your own taste test and see for yourself. Let me know what you think too!

My opinion of Pat's is on par with their running mate across the street, but my heart goes to Geno's since they were my very first.  

Love of cheese steaks was new for me and it was a confusing time in life, how could a guy choose just one meat?

All this being said I've run rampit around philly, knocking up all the pretty phillies I could wrangle.   They all have their own shine and their own down sides, but that's just the crazy game of love... I'm still talking cheese-steaks if you've gotten lost.    

okay, my time is up, go try everywhere you possibly can and message me your favorites!

Oh man, I loved Pat's! Okay, I'll be honest, I was nervous placing my order because of how long the line was when we came, how freezing cold it was and with Pat's being outdoors only there was no escape from the outdoor elements (well there's a roof) and the style orders needed to be placed in 'wit' or 'witout' (onions that is) and the barrage of pigeons watching my every move!

Luckily, the hubby and I were successful in getting our cheesesteak wiz wit and an order of cheese fries without a scratch. It was so cool to see the exact place where Sly Stallone stood while filming Rocky and looking up and all over at the celebrity love from famous patrons of the past and present. 

So, the service at Pat's was like this: Finger snap! The worker in the window would say ""next"" and the customer who had been rehearsing the order would provide it, also while handing out the exact total due for the food. Then the worker would yell out the short hand to the crew workinging the flat tops and then the customer would blink and then BAM! The sandwich would be there... Amazing, right? 

I guess the service at Pat's isn't too much more than this, but really, what more is needed? It seemed like diners would clean off their tables (or maybe the pigeons would help in that matter) and the napkins, peppers, utensils dispensers were full.

Okay, Pat's was the cheesiest, and I loved every bite of my piping hot cheese steak. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The onions were not at all overpowering (which would have upset me, but did not) and the crusty and chewy bread did a great job of holding it all together. There is a seperate line for fries and drinks, which I found to be helpful. The cheese fries were awesome! They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The cheese sauce was fantastic, as expected and we devoured the fires so quickly that they were not at all soggy. Thanks Pat's!

Bought a sandwich from each place and took a few bites of each first so as to judge without being full.


Pat's is the way to go. 

At Pat's the bread is warm and soft. The steak pieces are perfectly sliced and grilled with a nice blend of onions in it too. The Cheez Whiz is the best and classic cheese with it and it has the texture of real cheese whiz.

At Geno's the bread is hard, the steak seems to be some soy blend that reminds me of White Castle patties, and the ""cheese whiz"" was watery like it was blended with water and kept sitting out for the whole day. Terrible.

But here's the deal - I've been coming to Philly for years now and when we do we always try to stop for a cheesesteak somewhere-Pat's, Geno's, or Jim's have been the standards, and I've been to Pat's more than any other.  I like Pat's...I really do.  For all the whining about cleanliness and rudeness-please, reach out and grab a clue.  It's a cheesesteak place in South Philly, in an area that just isn't conducive to being 100% clean 100% of the time-get over it or just don't eat at one of these places.

My wife and I always get the same when we come to Philly - regardless of the place - Whiz, wit onions and mushrooms.  The kids get American without...is American cheese even really cheese?  I mean I KNOW Cheez Whiz isn't, but I'm not looking for a filet with gorgonzola here!  Anyway, even though Pat's may not be the go-to place for Philly folks, it's probably going to remain our go-to place for the forseeable future.  We've tried Geno's on multiple occasions and the HAVEN'T perfected the cheesesteak that Pat's introduced on this corner in 1930.  

In a nutshell, for Pat's 2728th review I will say Pat's beats Geno's.  Prices are the same, seating is the same, service is the same, cheesesteaks are better.  There, I said it...","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Pat's fries are way better than Geno's,  but Geno's wins the Cheesesteak battle by a nose.   Geno's just seem to be juicier.

I was in Phili and was told my multiple people to have a phili cheese steak. I'm from NY so i took the locals advice. I remembered seeing something on TV about Pat's and Geno's being across the street from each other and it is TRUE. you can be at Pat's and be looking at Geno's. The biggest difference between Pat's and Geno's. pat uses a Melted cheese wiz with chopped up meat and Geno's uses slices of cheese and does not chop there meat. I was told by a bunch of different people Pat's was better but they said it is personal prefrence. I went with pats! 

Parking was a B****. I had to park 6 blocks away in a grocery store parking lot. Due to all one way narrow streets. I'm not street parking my Vehicle in a area im unfamiliar with the crime situation it is too attractive to a criminal. being a non- Local im not taking a chance. It looked like a lot of people were walking to this location.

I went at lunch time on a saturday, which was a huge mistake. The line was about 1.5- 2 blocks long i'm not joking ether.The history of this place was cool there was a bunch of pictures of all of the famous people who have eaten at Pat's. I noticed a lot of people standing and eating. There was red picnic tables but everyone was filled. It smelled so good waiting on the line.

Once i got to the window there is a ordering routine at this place. i skrewed it up. I just wanted meat and cheese and i said cheese wit. i asked itf that was was just meat and cheese and the guy was like GET IT RIGHT! and then yelled to the rest of the line MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING BEFORE THE WINDOW. I handed him my debit card and he said read the sign cash only. This is a CASH ONLY! business  smart by pat's for tax purp and swipe fees.

 I handed the guy a $100 bill said they cant take the $100. he starts taking other peoples cash that ordered already. I wanted to leave The turn over rate for this place was amazing. i gave him a $50 and he took it. I said i'm sorry i'm from NY you guys do it different around here. He said You should be able to read signs. I got super pissed i told him to keep the change i only ordered 2 cheese steaks. The signs he was talking about were right above the cash register. the line wrapped around the building. I coulden't see the menu until i was at the window.  I just felt annoyed. It was cool that i could see the staff making my food.

I ran into some people i knew eating there sandwiches. They told me there cheese steaks were good. I brought mine back to my Hotel and ate it there. The cheese steak was really good. everything was moist and juicy. If i went back to ether Pat's or Geno's again. I would send someone else to get my food for me and pay them $50 just so i woulden't have to deal with the crazyness again. I dont know if it led up to all of the Hype.

PROS:
- Food was Really Good
- The history
-Watch them make your food

CONS
- Location
- Parking sucks
-Ordering system (If you are a non- Local)
- Cash only (do not take cards)","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I looked up the most popular ones, and read about Genos VS. Pats, right across the street from each other. So we figured we'd try one from each. We tried Genos first, and then went over to Pats. You definitely need to know exactly what you want when you get up to the window. These guys don't play around. No one was rude, they are just very to the point, and all about getting the food out quick. I preferred Pats as far as the meat, I like the more ""chopped up"" steak. Genos meat was more like thick slices. Pats bread wasn't as soft though, so I mostly just ate the filling out of the steak. The cheese wiz was really good though on these Philly steaks, I had never tried that before. So between Pats and Genos, I'd say I preferred Pats overall. Just be sure to order correctly- I was listening to other people order before and after us, and you can tell the locals from the tourists for sure. The locals simply for a ""wiz wit onions"".

Basically, you walk up to one window where you order your steak (my fave is whiz with onions). You fork over $8.50 - then you wait on line at the next window and order fries and a drink - and fork over another 8 bucks or so. Then you try and hold the steak, cup of fries and soda while wandering around looking for a free table or loitering in front of people that appear to be finishing up. It is a bit of a juggling act. There is no indoor seating or bathroom to speak of.

They do take credit cards, but it takes longer to process and you get lots of dirty looks from the cashier and people in line behind you.

Both places are located across from one another in South Philly at the crossroads of South 9th Street and East Passyunk Avenue.  In the middle of the ""x"" on one side is Pat's and across the street in the middle of the ""x"" is Geno's.

From Pat's we ordered  a mushroom steak wiz wit. (wiz=Cheese Whiz, wit=with onions) .

From Geno's we ordered a steak provolone wit.

We sat down at a table halved the subs and began our comparison.

In this food challenge Pat's beat Geno's hands down. The bread from Pat's was soft and warm and the meat was sliced thin, seasoned, juicy and tender. We did not think we would be fans of canned/jar cheese (Cheese Whiz) on a sandwich, however it worked and it was a pleasure to eat. On the other hand the bread from Geno's was a little tough and chewy.

As of now, there are almost 4,000 reviews on Yelp and Pat's is currently at 3 stars.  I'd say that's about right (I'm giving it three stars as well).  My sandwich was fine but it wasn't amazing.  I probably didn't have the freshest meat in my sandwich as I went really early in the morning.  It was fairly dry and didn't taste like a whole lot.

Meat was flavorful but on the dry side like it had been sitting out.  The bread really dominated the sandwich, and while it was good bread, this definitely needed more meat.

The bun was actually quite tasty, it was toasted and a bit crispy which I really liked and had a really good consistency and texture.

I definitely like Pat's cheese wiz without better than Geno's because Pat's bread is soft while Geno's bread is chewy.  Another differentiator is that Pat's steak is chopped up while Geno's is more intact slices.  Both cheesesteak stands are located in a cramped and dirty part of Philly where parking is hard to come by.  You order at the window and then if you're lucky, can a score a spot at a picnic table.  I was at Pat's in the dead of winter so there wasn't a line and our order came up immediately.

The cheesesteak had been flown in that same morning. Thank you, Tom.

For those who don't know, Pat's and Geno's are the most popular places to get a cheesesteak sandwich in Philadelphia. They are old and they are competitors. ""Pat's King of Steaks"" is the ""inventor and originator of the cheesesteak sandwich."" They've been in business since 1930. During one of my visits to Philadelphia, friends and locals steered me away from Pat's and Geno's, both of which are popular with tourists. Instead, I went to Jim's Steaks South Street: https://www.yelp.com/biz/jims-south-st-philadelphia.

It would not be fair to make a comparison of my experiences with Pat's and Jim's since I had to reheat Pat's cheesesteak at home while I had Jim's cheesesteaks fresh at the restaurant.

You can purchase Pat's cheesesteaks by mail-order through Goldbelly: https://www.goldbelly.com/pats-king-of-steaks. The cheesesteaks were shipped frozen with dry ice packs and reheating instructions. The cheesesteaks were already assembled and wrapped in Pat's signature logo'd white paper wrappers. The Cheez Whiz was packed in separate containers. At the time of writing this review, Goldbelly offered Pat's Original Philly Cheesesteaks in sets of four ($79 or $19.75 per sandwich), eight ($129 or $16.13 per sandwich), and 12 ($169 or $14.08 per sandwich). Shipping was included in the quoted prices.

Reheating was quick and easy. Instructions were to bake at 300 degrees for 10-14 minutes until the bread was lightly-crisped and the meat heated through. The Cheez Whiz could be reheated in the microwave or in a saucepan. I reheated the sandwich in my old toaster oven so it took a little longer than 14 minutes. I used the microwave to melt the Cheez Whiz.

I was impressed with how the sandwich turned out. It looked just like the cheesesteaks I saw of Pat's online. I had the ""Wit"" onions and Whiz version, but you can get ""Wit-Out"" onions and change the cheese to Provolone or American if you want. I think I may have baked the sandwich a little too long because the outside of the hoagie roll started to crack and it was extra crispy. That was okay, though, because the inside was warm, soft, and delectably chewy. The bread was good. There were plenty of tender morsels of quality ribeye, but what brought everything together was the melted Cheez Whiz. Mmm... That melted cheese coated the steak and eventually found its way to the bottom of the sandwich, soaking into the bread. This made each bite rich, flavorful, and really satisfying.

There aren't many ingredients - bread, meat, onion, cheese. Pat's found the right combination of quality, taste, and texture. If you're considering purchasing some of Pat's cheesesteaks via mail order, let this review be a vote of confidence. At the time of writing this, you can only get the Original Philly Cheesesteak via Goldbelly.

This is the archetype of the cheesesteak, it's classic form. 

Not as robust or hearty a sandwich as a Tony Luke's, but authentic South Philly just the same. The meat and cheese are scraped off the griddle and slid onto the bread. Served to you with the roll agape, its contents oozing & steaming. 

Pat's is THE place to go late night after the bar. 

Upon arrival at Pat's you will notice the interesting juxtaposition of rival sandwich shops at that intersection. Much has been said of both. Fierce allegiances exist on both sides. Pat's has the character & consistency. 

That other place is just a neon caricature owned by an outspoken xenophobe.

Also make note this place is CASH ONLY and you order cheesesteaks at the first window, then fries and drinks at the second window. Don't mess up the flow or I hear they will bump you to the back of the line.

Overall the flavor of the sandwich was very good. The hoagie roll was incredible; one of the best I have ever had. They chopped and almost diced the meat up which made for easier eating. I just wish there was more of the meat as pieces of it were far and few between in some bites. The grilled onions were heartily chunked and cooked perfectly, and just the right amount of Cheez Whiz.

I went with the cheese steak with onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese and have to say that Pats compared to Gino's had the upper hand on multiple levels as well as it seemed like it was a crowd favorite as the line that I had to wait in for Gino's was not as long is the line for Pats.

Overall I think it is a good experience, but not necessarily worth five stars I think it's really merely a tourist adventure or way for people to feel as if it's the same place they can come back to you and know what you're going to get each time. 

The biggest thing that stands out to me is the steak quality and taste. It's good to see the steak being cooked right in front of you and then moments after that it being placed in the hoagie. The onions are cooked properly with the mushrooms and not just thrown in the mix. All this with some provolone and it is with the 10 bucks!

It was time I went and found out what all the hype was about, so I made it a point to also try Geno's, which I did before I hit Pat's, only because I was feeling lazy and hungry and my car was parked slightly closer to Geno's. 

I left my experience from each place giving a narrow edge to Pat's. It seemed the steak was a tad more seasoned here, or perhaps it was the fact that this place seemed slightly grimier than Geno's and whatever lack of deep cleaning gives a little more character to their cheesesteaks. In fairness, however, I ordered provolone versus whiz at both places, which I'm sure is a violation of the rules according to most cheesesteak experts.

My brother came to see me from out of state and said that a friend of his said ""you gotta try Pat's"", so I begrudgingly did even though it was my first time here too. Looking at the prices, I thought it was incredibly overpriced for what you're getting. You better follow their order guidelines to tee or expect some serious man sass. A woman in front of us asked if she can get the cheesesteak cut in half. He raised his voice and was still working robotically ""no, we will not cut in half"" she asked again and this went on for a good 30 seconds. I was surprised to see him raise his voice at a woman that looked like he could be his grandmother. It was awful!

The cheeseteak: Nope. Nope. Nope. Bland, unappetizing. Even fake cheese (wiz) couldn't even save this sorry excuse for a sandwich. You're probably thinking ""well why don't you put some ketchup or mustard on this?"" My response: Get outta town! That's not authentic cheesesteakness!

We ordered cheesesteak, wit, wiz....aka a cheesesteak with onion and Cheese Whiz which we understand to be the definition of a cheesesteak.  We also ordered regular and cheesefries.  

Despite enjoying Geno's more, none of the five of us were impressed with  Philadelphia cheesesteaks.  They lacked flavor.  It was like eating unmarinated meat, onion, and bread covered in cheese.  I've had better cheesesteaks at other places around the country so it was a bit disappointing this was the standard that everyone references for cheesesteaks.  My son said if we ever return to Philadelphia, that he doesn't want a cheesesteak...and I think the rest of the family agrees.

Parking was problematic as there is nothing besides street parking and it was chaotic when we arrived.  There was a guy trying to make a few bucks who was directing traffic and said he would watch our car.  We returned and he was nowhere to be found but we sat nearby to watch the car as we didn't park in a proper spot.  A cop passed talking on his cell phone and didn't blink an eye so we figured we were alright.  

Pat's seemed to be about the speed.  Cheesesteaks were ready within seconds of ordering.  The cashier had attitude which I didn't appreciate and even my kids commented afterwards but I guess the attitude is normal for Pat's from what we've read.  I ordered two cheesesteaks, he gave me one, so then I asked about the second as another rep put one out, and he counted them for me...1...2.  I decided not to rip his head off and moved to the next window to order fries and drinks, also paid separately.  I made the mistake of asking the guy if he had a drink carrier, he looked at me, and then walked away.  Lovely people at Pat's.  It was a bit challenging to carry multiple drinks and fries.

The sandwiches themselves are so-so. The meat is a bit dry, the cheese is pretty weak, the bread is quite bland, and the overall flavor experience is lackluster.

We wern't hungry and got one at Genos and one at Pats just to compare, but as soon as we bit into a bite of Pats we were all over it, talking about it the whole week and finally gave in, drove back and got 5 more with wiz, peppers, mushrooms and onions and some of the awesome green and red peppers they have at the cart out front which rounded it off perfectly.

We always get cheesesteaks wiz wit! I'm personally not the type of person to get anything besides cheese wiz because it ends up being too dry for me. The onions and mushrooms top it off! Their fries are always so warm and delicious and there is cheese throughout! I love that there is cheese on the bottom and that you don't run out of cheese and have dry fries!! 

I've only been here about 20 times in my life but every single time I'm in damn heaven! It is my favorite treat ever when we travel to Philly to get cheesesteak and fries!

I have had many cheesesteaks in my day. Many. This has a flavor, a texture, and an old school experience you can't get in most places anymore. The sandwich was nice, tight and complete, the cheese came together with the texture of the steak. I drizzled a little hot pepper juice on top. It's worth it. People making their comments have had things LIKE cheesesteaks and forming opinions based on what is only similar, this however is the OG, what a cheesesteak sandwich is supposed to be like.

The battle is over in my book.

I had been to Geno's twice and never to pats. So this time it had to be Pat's.  

It was a long line, but a very quick one.  Got near the front of the line and I only started reading the 'how to order' sign which had hilarious comments and it was already my turn.  The order went smoothly and I was off to the fries and drinlks window.  The steak meat looked great where you could see them frying it up through the window as I passed. After I got all the food, I was glad my girlfriend was there to help me cause it was a lot of stuff to evacuate.  

We thought we'd have to leave with the food and eat it in the car because all the seats were occupied on the way in.  Fortunately one opened up as we headed for the car.  

First let me say the fries were excellent.  Kind of a crispy flavored fry.  Definitely a nice surprise.  After we sat down a guy who cleans the tables came around and offered us some napkins.  He was quite a character and engaged many of the patrons in conversation.  I think he is a great ambassador for the place, really liked his demeanor.  The steaks were great we had ours 'wiz wit'.  Good stuff, nice rolls.  There was a little bit of gristle in the meat we didn't care for, but you'll have that with real meat.

The place was clean and nice looking.  The staff were courteous, industrious and efficient. I would definitely go back.

As for Geno's I think it is just as good.  There is something to be said about going to the source and ';rockin it from the cradle', but there are great steak shops all over Philly and in the surrounding areas as well.  

Gotta do it if you're there, but some local shops are just as good.

Although the line was long, it moved quickly. Once you place your order, you get your sandwich within minutes.

I even brought friends from California and boasted the whole time that Pat's was iconic and the best. After having it for the first time, they weren't thrilled about it and neither was I. I came out in August 2020 and explained at the window that I was taking some back home and needed the cheese separate. They actually did it for me and I put in the freezer and ate it a couple of weeks later. I then came out for New Years' 2021, and the dude at the window wearings a 76ers mask was being a dick and said they don't do that, never have, and never will. So I ended up bringing home some soggy ass cheesesteaks.

We stopped by Pat's first since the overall trusty Yelp rating was so much higher.  The three of us split two: the cheesesteak wit whiz and onions, mushrooms, and peppers and a cheesesteak wit whiz and onions.

The two main differences between the infamous rivalries: 1) Pat's has a more extensive menu, 2) Pat's dices while Geno's slices their meat.

Of the two we ordered here, I liked the cheesesteak wit whiz, onions, mushrooms and peppers.  The peppers added a really nice tangy element to the cheesesteak.

The cheesesteak wit whiz and onions sorely lacked flavor.  I was disappointed...so of course we had to go across the way to Geno's for comparisons sake and ordered the same thing.  Geno's was much more cheesy, juicy and overall flavorful!  Perfectly seasoned!

So, if you love the extras like I do, go to Pat's and order the cheesesteak with all the extras.  If you're a purist, go to Geno's for a flavorful cheesy-meat explosion in a bun.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Isgro's has some of the best pastry you will find anywhere in the USA.

Anastasi's seafood is a good place if you want to buy good fish and seafood to bring home and carefully make - not much to look at though...

Ordering is simple, for me, pepper cheesesteak wit with provolone (I'm not a cheese wiz girl).  Food was ready before we finished paying.  Separate window for drinks and fries.  

We grabbed one of the many tables surrounding Pat's and started eating.  I loved the peppers, onions, and provolone with mine, it was a wonderful combination and the peppers gave a sweet note with every bite.  It was a little greasy, but what cheesesteak isn't?  We both devoured our cheesesteaks and enjoyed every morsel.  The bowling ball that hits the bottom of your stomach afterwards is a completely different review.  It tastes so wonderful going down that you're willing to put up with the discomfort afterwards.

In doing my research, Pat's seemed to be the destined place to visit. The spot was nestled in an Italian neighborhood of Philly with parking being a bitch. We literally went around in circles for 20 minutes and finally walked our way to this joint. 

 Pat's was busy. Across from Pat's was another cheesesteak joint known as Geno's that seemed to be equally busy. Obviously, we knew we had to visit Geno's right after to do a comparison of the two. 

 Pat's had some seating al fresco. The menu was pretty simple...cheesesteaks and hot dogs and fish cakes...and cash only.

CHEESESTEAK WITH PROVOLONE ($11.00): This was just ok for me. I liked the steak but the cheese didn't really do anything for me. I thought the flavor of the meat with the onions went well together, but it just needed more sauce and flavor.  

MY FAVORITE DISH. CHEESESTEAK ($11.00): Cheesesteak wit whiz. This was my favorite. I love the steak with whiz. I think that's how the Phillys do it and the only way to do it. The cheese seasons the steak and makes it creamy and luscious. I love it and its the only way to do it. Onions and all and the bread held up to all the meat.  

Overall, I thought Pat's was pretty good. It's a simple menu of cheesesteaks with the type of cheese of your choice. I personally think its advised to order the steaks with whiz. I could eat multiple of these. We didn't bother with the hot dogs or the fish cakes cause our focus was on the cheesesteaks. Be prepared to wait.

When driving down the block, Geno's is definitely more eye-catching, but I've never been one to judge a restaurant by the number of flashing lights it has -- almost over-compensating, with how much the lights blind you. 

I will be honest and say that I don't have any basis of comparison as this was my first ever cheesesteak, but I really enjoyed my meal here, and the experience as a whole. The line moves scarily fast, leaving you almost no time to prepare yourself to say ""Whiz wit"" (with onions) or ""Whiz wit-out"" (without onions) and to get your money ready (CASH ONLY). You get your sandwich within 5 seconds, and then you're on your way to pick up napkins, hot peppers, utensils, etc. 

As for the cheesesteak itself, the meat was a liiiittle on the dry side, but the slathering of warm gooey CheezWhiz makes up for it. I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try the hot peppers, but my friends swear by them. I really liked the texture of the bread and the fact that it wasn't soggy, but actually still had a slight crisp to it. The cheesesteak is also just the right size -- enough to make me plenty full, but not to the point of bursting at my seams.

We ordered a Wiz without at both places. Now I have been a loyal Geno's guy for years but my loyalty is wavering.

Pat's was chopped up and I could taste the flavor! The rolls and the whiz were both a wash, both tasting just as good. Pat's Wiz without cost $9.50, I  guess the 50 cents was worth the flavor, when in the area the next time I am gonna go to Pat's King of Steak's to try a whole Wiz with and then I will make my final decision.

Geno's is not chopped and had more fat on it. It was also not as meaty! It was also kind of blah!  Price of a Geno's Wiz Without $9.00, for me I would rather spend the 50 cents and be satisfied.  

Both have outside seating, so make sure to dress according to the weather. Also at both places you order your steak at the first window and your drinks and fries at the second window.  Also make sure you have cash because both places do not accept plastic.

I must add that John's Roast Pork makes a far superior cheese steak, and that you should try theirs instead. Both Pat's & Geno's are riding on their reputation and is really just a big tourist trap.

I will give Pat's 4 Stars & Geno's 3!","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

As I was nearing the end of the 30 minute line, my pulse quickened as I tried to remember whether I was supposed to proclaim my cheese preference before or after stating that onions should be included. But apparently it was extremely overblown, because all of the self-proclaimed cheesesteak experts (and there are a lot of these idiots out there on the world wide interwebs) made a bigger deal out of ordering a cheesesteak than was necessary. I yelled ""1 WHIZ WIT, AND 1 PROVOLONE WIT!"" at a higher octave than planned in my head, handed over $20, got my change, and within 10 seconds, was left holding two sandwiches while looking around stupidly for my friend to pull up with his car. 

But I digress from what really matters: the cheesesteak. I always thought that if Chester the Cheetah had diarrhea, it would look like cheese whiz, so I'd always take the safe (albeit delicious) route of Provolone. But I figured, ""what the hell, let's see what the big deal is."" I was pleasantly surprised. The whiz worked nicely with the sandwich, oozing in all its neon glory into the meat, and adding the right amount of cheesiness without overpowering it. The meat was hot, flavorful, but somewhat tough when compared to other cheesesteak establishments that I've been to. The bread; honestly, I don't remember anything about it. Overall, my impressions were that the sandwich was filling, warm, and delicious, although the chewy meat, long wait time, and somewhat steep price for what is effectively a medium sized sandwich geared toward tourists from New Jersey (everyone in front of me had the accent) keeps it from being perfect. I know there's better out there, but I left Pat's feeling satisfied and if that doesn't deserve some stars I'm not sure what does.

I didn't do a side by side comparison with Geno's, as recommended by so many people. I refuse to try Geno's because: (1) Geno's looks incredibly garish (like the worst of what Vegas has to offer), (2) Yelpers (Yelpees? Yelps? What are they called?) on average think it's crap compared to Pat's, and (3) the incredible ignorance of the establishment refusing to serve anyone who doesn't speak in English annoys me.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The steak has more flavor and it isn't dry, unlike its competitor. I ordered the cheese whiz wit, and it was fine. However, for a place that's supposedly known for its cheesesteaks, they need to step up their game. Maybe it's the bread - it's pretty chewy. That could also be due to the fact that we visited at midnight and maybe the bread was stale by then. But if you're going to be a 24 hour establishment, you better make sure to find away to keep that bread fresh. The quality should be consistent. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was in the area, I wouldn't mind grabbing a sammie from here.

The guy at the airport recommended Pat's and said it's the best in Philly. Not too sure about that.

The line was pretty long which was too be expected, Geno's was as well. The Eagles Cowboys game had just finished and of course the Eagles lost... so the fans were on edge while waiting in line. I would say we got to the order window in about 25 to 30 minutes. They have a pretty strict policy about knowing how to order and knowing what you want when you get to the front.. obviously.. they want the line to stay moving. I get it. 

The particular time we went they were out of nacho cheese which was a disappointment. The cheesesteak tasted just average. It looked average. To wait 30 minutes a cold, long line, it just didn't really live up to the hype for me. Maybe nacho cheese and something else on it would have gotten me to a 4 star but just wasn't to be.

I already had tempered expectations for Pat's and knew there was going to be a big potential for letdown based on what I've heard from my foodie friends, but being in Philly for the first time, I had to try either Pat's or Geno's solely based on how long they've been around and how much I see them on food specials.

I came on a Friday around 2pm, and luckily street parking wasn't too hard to find within a block of Pat's. There was also no line, which took a lot of the pressure off from ordering. Being my first time here, I made it a point to read all the instructions BEFORE ordering. But even then, the guy at the counter was rushing me to get my order. First of all, I'm reading the directions as it says to do so I don't mess up. Secondly, and more importantly, THERE'S NOBODY BEHIND ME. Chill out. There's no need to be rude as I'm not holding up the line. I am the only person in line! Ended up ordering a mushroom cheesesteak with provolone (I'm not a fan of wiz) and a side of fries.

The fries were actually pretty good, but the cheesesteak was rather disappointing. I don't understand why it costs $10. The bun is soggy. The mushrooms were sliced canned mushrooms that were rubbery and flavorless. The steak wasn't generously portioned, and it was overcooked to the point where it was chewy and there wasn't much flavor.

Sometimes even when you feel like you're making a mistake, it's a mistake you have to make for yourself to learn. That was me before coming here. Don't let it be you! Just goes to show you that just because they've been around since 1930 and claim to be one of the first cheesesteaks doesn't mean they're the best.

I actually kickstarted my Philly trip by stopping by Geno's first, but there was no way I was driving home without eating here. My review compares Pat's to Geno's, so read my review of the latter if you'd like a better idea.

LINE/ORDERING:
Pat's system is the same as Geno's (...or is Geno's the same as Pat's?)--line up at the first window to order your cheesesteak, then walk a few feet to your left for drinks and fries. Sandwiches fly out the window within seconds, so don't leave the line until you get your order.

The classic cheesesteak (Cheese Whiz and onions) is called a ""Cheese Wit,"" which is what Tommy (the manager/cashier) relays to the staff. You could also say ""Whiz Wit."" 

FOOD:
x3 Cheese Wit/Whiz Wit ($10/ea): The sandwiches here are the same size and price, while the ratio of meat-cheese-onions is on point (and perhaps better than Geno's). The main differences, however, are as follows: The bread here is softer, the steak is chopped, you get more steak in your sandwich, the cheese whiz is (for some reason) not as salty, and the sandwich isn't greasy. Taste wise, both places are similar, but I taste more of the (unseasoned) rib-eye here.

We also ordered x2 drinks and an order of fries for $12. The fries here, compared to Geno's, are thicker, larger, and crispier. Good, but again, nothing special about them.

SERVICE: 
Tommy was the one who took my order. He's one of the famous faces at Pat's, and chances are you've seen him on Travel Channel or Food Network episodes featuring this place. He's a cool dude, but don't hold up the line. Learn how to order or at least know what you want by the time you get to the window.

THE BIG QUESTION:
Is Pat's truly the King of Steaks or did Geno's usurp the throne? As much as I'd like to say one is better than the other, I can't. Pat's is famous for many reasons, and Geno's is great in its own right and holds its weight. The sandwiches have their differences with one another, but both are good. All I can say is that the media has done an amazing job building up this fabled cheesesteak rivalry in South Philly. It's done wonders for both Pat's and Geno's and, most importantly, for the popularity of the cheesesteak itself.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Pat's is super cool looking, it is a place where you order outside, there is no inside seating. There is outside seating but not a lot, there is no bathroom and parking is a bear. But you can walk to Citizen's Bank Park for a baseball game from there if you want. The building is all silver metal, like a silver lined trailer, sort of. The menu is on the outside and they don't take credit cards so have cash ready. The service is very nice.

Some people order their steak with Cheese Wiz. Now, that is some junk that comes from a can and is put on your sandwich. If you have never had it, I would not even bother to try it. I find it just gross. I don't want cheese out of a spray can. I don't even know if it is real cheese. So, just don't. Yuk. Also, their American cheese is not great. Play it safe and get your steak with Provolone Cheese. That is real.

The meat is cooked well done, which I find boring and it is not great, but it is fine. So, I guess I just told you this place is not very good. It is fine. It is fun.

Pat's is by no means the best steak in Philly, but it slides into my top 10 for now. The roll was excellent and the seasoning of the chopped ribeye enhanced the flavors nicely.

A knock against the steak that I would say is that is got colder more quickly than Geno's. I like when a steak stays thoroughly warm, and the sandwiches heat only lasted so long.

For all the hate both of these spots get, neither are as bad as you hear. Pats reminds me of a how a good Philly cheesesteak should taste: lots of meat, good presentation, strong flavors.

It's a 'Dick's Drive-In' kind of vibe (for those familiar with that Seattle staple). 

Basically, you walk up to the window stand, order your cheesesteak ('wit' or 'witout' meaning with or without onions), grab and pay, then you go to the second window if you want to order fries (again, 'wit wiz'... this cheese wiz stuff everyone's obsessed with out here). There's a place to grab condiments, napkins and straws behind, and there's tons of outdoor seating.

CON: if you come here late at night, during winter, like I did, be prepared to freeze and eat fast!!!! 

I'll say this. I'm not a huge cheesesteak person in general. They're good, but I never really crave them. I ate them a lot in high school when my boyfriend at the time worked at a East Coast Sub place. I was persecuted at the window (not by the people who work there) when I 'horrifically' ordered the cheesesteak with peppers, mushrooms and onions and 'WITOUT' the cheese wiz. MISTAKE. As much as I'm not a fan of this cheese wiz stuff, I get why people order it. The meat is SO damn dry you NEED the cheese wiz to moisten it up a bit!

I also (eating with people from Philly) was persecuted for wanting to put ketchup on my cheesesteak, again, because it was so dry! I guess there's a right way to eat them and I wasn't playing into it. The fries were good. Nothing special.

I've been to Philly several times and have yet to find a cheesesteak that's better than I have had at my local Jersey Mike's. After finally succumbing to the hype, I finally broke down and tried Pat's. Needless to say, my one-star rating means I'm still searching.

As with all of the other places I've tried in Philly, there must be some appeal to slapping a flavorless hunk of shaved meat and onions on a dry roll. Not even Cheez Whiz could help this 8"" long piece of the Sahara Desert. I mean seriously, a little salt and pepper would help immensely because it's a sad commentary when the fries and Coke are what make the meal palatable, not the signature item on the menu.

I think what irks me the most is the glaringly obvious, complete and total lack of care that goes into the food. For $70 to get 4 cheesesteaks, 3 fries, and 4 drinks, at least put SOME effort into it.

I won't try Geno's across the street because it's more of the same hype that keeps it and Pat's in business. Avoid Pat's and let's put an end the scourge of this overhyped monstrosity.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

As far as the steak, no one beats Pat's.  The bread is good, but it does have a tendency to fall apart.  The sandwich itself isn't as salty as most other places which allows the flavors to blend and dance in your mouth.  The steak has some bite to it and a great rich flavor.  I ordered the mushroom pizza cheesesteak wit onion and cheese wiz.  The flavor is subtle but wonderful.  Hot, juicy and wonderful.  It goes down so quickly I was actually was more hungry after I ate then when I started.  One of the draw backs is they only take cash.  But, just like many other places they have one window for sandwiches and another for fries and drinks.  This helps things move along quickly, but, follow the rules.  Pat's doesn't have time for people to think about their order.  Know what you want before you get to the window.  It doesn't matter, everything is awesome!

Tips for Ordering at Pat's

The line at Pat's King of Steaks moves quickly, so it's best to be prepared -- know what you want, and how to order it by the time you get to the front of the line!

Step 1
Specify if you want your steak with (wit) or without (wit-out) onions

Step 2
Specify Plain, Cheez Whiz, Provolone, American or Pizza Steak

Step 3
Have your money ready. We are cash only.

Step 4
Order just your steak at the first window. The second window is for fries and drinks.

Step 5
Eat up while it's hot! Honestly, when it comes to Pat's, I figured it would be best to ""borrow"" their Tips for Ordering (pasted above). That's really all you need to know.... Whether you want a Steak, a Hot Dog, a Pork or a Fish Cake, the most important aspect of Pat's is knowing how to order. The food?

I did the challenge on Monday July 7th at 3:00pm. I headed to Geno's and Boyfriend grabbed Pat's. He had only ever had pat's and I said this was unacceptable. He also didn't want to get whiz and I said we had to get whiz at both to have a comparison. He reluctantly agreed. Because of this, I have to idea what the process was like at Pat's all I know is the their birch beer fountain soda was 50 cents more than Geno's. 

We got one wit whiz. It was not what I was expecting. The chopped meat had a meaty flavor but more like standard pot roast tasting beef. The onions were great all carmelized and buttery. Their bread was weirdly soft and bland. From the looks of it I expected more in both taste and texture. It is a good sponge but I think we got a slightly dry steak than usual. I looked at yelp pictures of soaking buns and juicy meat and ours didn't seem that way. There wasn't as much whiz as I would like. I didn't think their whiz tasted as good as Geno's. In Short, Geno's won in the whiz category.

Now, because the boyfriend always got a provolone steak at Pat's he was craving his favorite. We skipped french fries and ordered another steak from pats, this time one wit provolone. Wow, what a difference the cheese made. I think our meat was a fresher batch that was juicier as well. The onions were once again great. The chopped meat flavor was complemented by the generous provolone serving. This was what you think of when you think ""cheese steak"". 

So Geno's for Whiz and Pat's for Provolone. That is my contribution to the challenge.

I will add that if pat's used the bread at geno's that they may have won both categories but unless they are serving up super juicy meat and not being stingy with the whiz there is no way that bread makes sense. It is merely a vehicle and in such a simple sandwich is really should be more than that.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Cash only & have it ready! Window #1 is just for the steak with window #2 being for fries and drinks. 
Again, everyone raves about the whiz. But when I saw it on someone else's sandwich it seems really runny. I decided to be adventurous and get the cheese steak with provolone instead. It was a mistake. The cheese was not melted and the texture hindered me from enjoying the steak. Once I took off the cheese it was a much better experience. The steak was a little greasier than the competition but it was still good.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

On the contrary, Pat's is really low-key. It doesn't have brightly lit signs, the workers appear to be more laid back, and the menu isn't electronic. I elected to go to Pat's over Geno's because it felt less like a tourist trap than Geno's.

After picking up my California friend at 30th Street Station, we wove our way down to  South 9th Street for a taste of Philadelphia - the renowned, Pat's.  My 12 year old son came along when he heard we would go for cheesesteaks.  

The environment around Pat's is terrific.  People all over the place.  The queue to order.  The Rules for Ordering.  The smack in the puss aroma of burning grease and onions.  The whole migila.  I felt my own excitement rise the closer I came to the ordering window.  I felt the vicarious thrill as my son ordered his first Cheesesteak Witout and Provolone, and a Birch Beer.  Truly, a right of passage. 

Yet, when we sat down at a red metal grate table and began to devour our sandwiches, I noted my son's displeasure with the amount of fat and gristle he had to  spit out.  I, too, was surprised to find red meat in my tumultuous pile of steak, onions, mushrooms and cheese.  Uncooked.  It felt careless. I did not mind that each time I picked up the load to have a bite, and equal amount fell out the back end of the 'wich. That was to be expected from an unfortunate roll incapable of holding its load.  Still, I did not feel like picking up the canned shrooms  and steak pieces to eat them.

We took a long road trip from Atlanta to Maine, making stops all along the way at places I've been wanting to try for years. Everything from authentic NY pizza and pastrami to authentic Maine lobster rolls were preset into my GPS navigation.  Well, I don't know how I could call myself a food lover and not have an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak from the two originals, so on this trip I rectified that!

I've never been to any of the states north of the Carolina's on the East coast and decided last year we are going to curtail our preferred mode of vacationing (cruises), to spend more time touring all the great places we've been missing around our own country. After all, our boys are getting older and there is only so much time we have left before they might not think it's cool to hang out with us... LOL

THE EXPERIENCE
I was a total tourist during my visit to Pat's. Taking pictures, laughing with locals and hamming it up with the kitchen staff. It may just be my personality, but we don't generally have problems with people. I've read a lot of reviews about the staff both here and across the street @ Geno's being rude, even saw it on a Food Network show. However, they were fantastic with us. My excitement to be there must have been infectious because they even came out to take pics and cracked a few jokes. 

As usual with touristy places, you are bound to run into others who came a long distance just to try them. We ran into one couple also doing a steak comparison and had just finished their first steaks @ Geno's. They made for an enjoyable conversation as we shared our crazy food adventures. It always make me feel better to know that I'm not the only person in this world that travels for food !

~~~~~~~~~~

THE CHEESESTEAK
I HATE Cheese Whiz. It is a violation of basic food decency and have been repelled from any establishment that even suggests putting it on my food. So when I found out Philadelphians prefer it, I made it up in my mind I would give it a try so as to have the most authentic experience possible. Under protest of course, because the backup plan was to throw it away if I didn't like it and order another with provolone, the cheese of the food gods!!!

I was stupefied at just how amazing whiz can taste on a Philly cheesesteak. Not in a million years would I have guessed I would love it as much as I did. But then again it could simply be the way Pat's blends it with the meat. It's not just poured on top as I expected. No, it's mixed into the blend of beef and onions during the cooking process, setting of an orgy of deliciousness.

I'm a Chicago native. The meat in our cheesesteaks is much more finely diced, almost to the point of looking like ground beef, which is how I prefer my cheese steaks.  Pat's does not chop their beef up nearly as much, but it is certainly more finely chopped than its rival Geno's for sure. It make the sandwich easier to eat, more tender and in my opinion, creates a more balance flavor between all the ingredients. Most people mistake the finer chop for a lesser quality meat, but nothing could be further from the truth. I'd be willing to bet the meat each uses probably comes from the same vendor. They just slice and season it differently.

~~~~~~~~~~

FINAL THOUGHTS
Food is a personal experience not always based on how good something actually is, but how good it is in comparison to other life experiences. It may be tied to memories with loved ones or a bad experience with a past relationship. Whatever subjective feeling you have, no one can really take away how the inner you reacts to it. 

As for me, Pat's was probably the singular most soul satisfying meal I had during my entire three week vacation up the East coast. Took me back, way back to simpler days. I love food (all food) but you should know by now I'm not fancy. If I were food, this sandwich is truly me on a plate. My eyes rolled back in my head as my taste buds screamed 'Don't stop, git it, git it!'   Winner - Pat's.

Con:  If you scroll through the reviews of Pat's, you will find that many of the better ones are written by non-Philadelphians. This illustrates two points...1) Pat's is a bit of a tourist trap, and 2) Locals know that a better cheesesteak can be found in Philly. Ladies and gents, both points are right!

My first time in Philadelphia, i had to try a cheesesteak.  After a bit of a search, seems like it came down to pats v genos.  I decided on pats for no reason in particular.
when i drove into the area at 5:30 on a sunday, it took me a few laps around the block to find a parking space.  Parked about a block away, started my walk.
go in line, probably 20 people ahead of me.  The line seemed to move pretty fast i thought.  I'm thinking i waited between 10-15 minutes to place my order.  I noticed that genos was right across the street from pats, thought that was interesting.
soooo, there are signs directing you on how to order.  Sammies at the first window, fries and drinks at the second.  No problems for me in ordering.  Got to the window.  I was greeted with ""next,step up"".  Guy taking my order didnt seem that friendly.  Didnt really matter to me, i just wanted to eat.
I ordered the extra cheese steak wit whiz.  Everything is already prepared.  They had my Sammy assembled in about 30 seconds.  Onto the next window for a coke to wash it down with
they do have some seating around the bldg.  i just so happened to catch a group leaving and grabbed a table.  Opened it up, thought ok this looks great!.  HOWEVER, the steak was bland, it needed some help.  The whiz was good, as you can see by the pic, they loaded the whiz.  The bun was fresh, whiz was hot, but that steak was pretty bland.  I ate about half, wrapped it up for my 4 hour drive home.  So let me say, after the 4 hour drive i was hungry when i got home.  They bread was not mushy or greasy, tasted pretty good after the road trip.  I believe my total was right around $17 for the Sammy and drink.
i do believe that I have 2 places near where i live that are better than pats.  Next time I'm in philly, i shall check out another place.  My advice, give that steak some love pats.  Enjoy the pics","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

The steak sandwiches were very good as expected. I am surprised that neither Geno's or Pats seasons the meat. You get beef flavor but if you order the pepper steak you get mostly the pickled pepper kicks along with the salty cheese sauce. I add lots of pepper and no salt is need with the yellow cheese. If you get a provsteak then salt and pepper are a must. A splash of pepper sauce is good however, no added mustard or sauce is necessary. Very friendly staff but be ready to order and don't fu@£ around. They serve how and fast and cash only. If you can't parallel park please walk or get a real driver to drop your a$$ off. It's a bust X intersection and no one appreciates waiting on amateurs to park or order when it's busy. I've learned it's not personal but the more you hold the line the longer people have to wait.

Despite the insults, I did not argue and moved to the soft drink and fried order line. Those guys were a lot more professional. 

Overall, the cheesesteaks were small relative to the ones at Reading Market but tasty. But we all liked the food. 

However, I won't go back nor recommend others to go because:
- the sandwiches were pre-made - not sure if they are fresh
- the staff hated the customers and treated us badly

As for when we arrived Pats is a simple place with picnic tables outside where you will enjoy your meal. We ended up getting two cheesesteaks - one with wiz and the other with American to test out the different options. Fresh & hot I enjoyed the meat portion that came with Pat's subs. Since the meat was a little more chopped up it allowed the cheese to flow in between the crevices of the cheesesteak. Was it extraordinary?

Because of its big name and the story of its rivalry with the place across it, Pat's draws patrons from different corners of the globe including those from the City of Brotherly Love. As a result of a huge volume of business that usually results in long lines, it earns a reputation from its utilitarian service. 

To streamline ordering, Pat's has two different areas for ordering, one exclusively for sandwiches, and the other is for fries and drinks. There's an area where you can load up on condiments, such as pepper and ketchup. They do not give you any napkins, even though there is a fresh stack of napkins clearly behind the window. They expect you therefore to get them yourself. 

They also expect you to know the proper lingo in order to order a steak. There's a sign by the front that tells you how to order a steak there. It includes a warning that if you mess your order, you're obliged to head to the end of the line to try all over again. If you want a cheesesteak, you're supposed to state what type of cheese you want. You're getting a choice of provolone, Cheese Whiz, American. Don't be fancy and attempt to order Swiss, feta cheese, camembert, or roquefort. Next, you're given a choice of onions (wit) or without onions (witout). Mushrooms are 50 cents extra after tax.

Even when we arrived at 10am when there were no lines, they expected us to get up to speed with what's going on. Know the lingo. Know where things were. 

I ordered a mushroom provolone wit (mushroom cheesesteak with provolone and onions) for $10.50. After I placed my order, my meal was ready in less than a minute. That was how quick the whole thing was. The bread came a little soggy, but the steak was pretty good. They chop the steak here and serve it with cheese. If you want sliced meat, you should go to Geno's. 

In my previous times of visiting Philadelphia, I never went to either Pat's or Geno's, knowing of the lines. But because it was Crystal's first time, we decided to go.

The main difference in the two sandwiches is the steak. Pat's chops their steaks up and then pours the cheese on top and then the toppings. So everything melds together and it's great. Geno's has a slab of meat that they then pour everything on top - and it's just not as good. So if you find yourself between the two one day and the lines are about the same - I'd go for Pat's.

One complaint I have, and this is probably about Philly and/or cheesesteaks in general. The term 'wit' sounds a lot like the word 'whiz'. So if you're trying to get a cheesesteak with whiz only, it's possible that you will wind up 'wit' which means ""add onions to my sandwich, please."" And anyone who knows me knows that phrase will never come out of my mouth - ever. So I wound up going home with a whiz wit, instead of a whiz witout. Not the end of the world, I was able to scrape the onions off, but I feel like I sacrificed some whiz in the process and therefore didn't get the full effect. 

Even so, even with the order snafu, Pat's won out over Geno's.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Well my wife and arrive in Philly about 11ish and this was our first stop.....1st time in Philly why not stop at the Infamous ""Tourist Trap - Pat & Geno's (I'm starting to think they should squash the rivalry and just combine the two...it's not like they both are any better then the other).....Ok I'm getting ahead of myself. 

So we find parking (and yes we had to search near and far to park) after finding a parking spot over and around the Mulberry bush we then walked several blocks till we found ourselves in the crossfire of the two PAT'S & GENO'S..... My wife and I came up with a game -plan she would get a Cheese Steaks from Pat's and I would get one from Geno's and we would see who's the best. 
After standing in line for about 20 min a piece we met back up in the middle of the street (because I overheard some folks saying that the two places do not allow each others food and products over in their respective areas) A bunch a nonsense if you ask me...... 

So in the middle of the street on top of a mail box we have the two Cheese Steaks sitting there side by side....I take half of the Geno's and my wife takes half of Pat's so we bite into each half expecting and thinking that we are about to taste heaven itself...........WOMP WOMP WOMP!!!!!!!!!!!!! A total disappointment..... 

In my mind I was thinking...""if this is the best that Philly has to offer then Philly may want to rethink what food they want to add there name too."" 

Pat's & Geno's both: 
- Had VERY bland Cheese Steaks (hardly NO flavor to either one) 
- Not enough Steak 
- Very rude (as if I the customer owe them something in addition to my 8 dollars) I have never met a group of individuals that have a well-known establishment treat and look at there customers as if they are mad that we choose to stop here. 

Bottom line....coming to Pat & Geno's was worth the trip here ONLY to say that I have been there but the food is not worth bragging about or even coming back too if I am in desperate need or craving for a true Philly Cheese Steak. 

Too conclude or trip in Philly 8 hours later....I called a buddy of mine who is a Native Philly Residents and he informed me about a spot in North Philly called ""Paganos"".....we stop here on our way leaving Philly and if you want to know the rest about this GOD SENT PLACE....then you have to read about its page.

As many have mentioned, it's right across the street from Genos, and those of us from Philly are pretty loyal to one or the other. For me, Pat's steaks are just more flavorful, better made and more delicious. I also think their fries are better. And they serve Coke. And, when you look at the two businesses, it should be apparent which one is better. Genos must need all that neon for a reason. #Justsayin.

One note to all of the reviews about rude behavior: It's part of the thing. Call it ambiance or whatever, it's part of the experience of getting a cheesesteak in South Philly. At Pat's you are expected to be ready to order, to know HOW to order and to not hold the line up. If you can do those three things, you will get what you ordered lickety split and enjoy a delicious meal. It aint fancy, but it's not supposed to be. If you don't like it, go to the Four Seasons and leave the rest of us alone.

If you are new or just visiting and are nervous, that's understandable. We're not unreasonable. So ask the people around you while you wait in line. Or follow my handy guide for newbies...

1. There are TWO lines. One for cheesesteaks and one for fries/sodas. You can't get fries in the cheesesteak line. You can't get steaks in the fries line. It is best to bring at least two people. The cheesesteak line is almost always longer, so the person in charge of fry ordering should wait until their partner is fairly well along in the cheesesteak line before stepping up to the window so that you both come out with food at the same time. 

2. Fries. You can and should get cheese fries. They are drenched in Cheez Wiz and are AWESOME.... the type you have to eat with a fork and the type where there's a big pool of cheese down in the bottom of the cup.

3. CASH only. Don't ask about credit cards. You'll look stupid. Like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld, it's best to have your cash out when you order.

4. Ordering. Do it right. They have gotten a bit more lenient in recent years, but there was a time in which a bad orderer would be sent to the back of the line. You say two words and two words only: the type of cheese followed by WIT or WITOUT (ie, with or without fried onions). Yes, you can get other cheese and other stuff but I highly recommend Wiz Wit for your first time out (see next point below). The only other words you need are numbers (as in ""TWO Wiz Wits"").

5. Wanna be branded as an outsider? Order something other than Wiz on your steak. Yes, there are other cheese options, but orders with Provolone are like announcing you're not from around here. You traveled all the way to an odd corner in South Philly to sample a REAL Philly cheesesteak. So suck it up and order a REAL steak -- WIZ WIT is all you need to say.

6. Tables. Red picnic tables line the sidewalk all the way around Pat's. Ideally you should bring a third person whose job it will be to troll the area for an available table and snag it while your other two people do the line thing in point #1. I've gone to Pat's at all hours of the day -- steaks for midnight snacks, steaks for breakfast, and it's extremely rare to go there and find a bunch of empty tables. At the very best, it's not jam-packed. So having a table scout can pay off big time during busy times.

7. Parking. Pat's and Genos are located pretty much right in the middle of a neighborhood, separated by a neighborhood baseball field. The only option is street parking. It's tight and hard to find sometimes. If you suck at parallel parking, bring someone who knows what they're doing. Not the place for rookies. Or take a cab from a safer locale.

I remember the first time I went to Pat's and Geno's during Spring Break (this is before I discovered Yelp); my friend and I were coming from Myrtle Beach,SC to Brooklyn, NY and decided to stop here for a 'midnight snack'. I ordered a cheese steak with provolone from Pat's and one with Cheese Whiz from Geno's, onions in both. After eating both of them , I decided that Geno's is the King of Steaks and doused my friend with his soda as an official declaration . Okay that didn't happen, but I was thinking it.

Enough reminiscing, though. It has been nearly six months and Caleb P. is back in Philadelphia and it's official: the only thing keeping Pat's and Geno's alive is pure publicity. 

The simple fact is this: These two places serve the most delicious cheese steaks ever made. Delicious? Actually, a better word would be: horrendous, disgusting, grotesque, disturbing. Rather, any combination of the previously listed words would be more appropriate than 'delicious'.

After coming here the second time, I realize that the Cheese Whiz masks how poor this cheese steak is. Order everything and have provolone instead of Cheese Whiz and you will discover how unbelievably tough, dry, and lacking the meat is. I won't say any more, rather I will let you find out yourself.

The thing is about Geno's and Pat's is summarized in the last sentence of the previous paragraph: ""....rather I will let you find out yourself."" I can continue on how tough the meat is, how limp the bread is, or how overcooked the onions are. I can rant, throw a tantrum, scream to the world, but that won't stop anyone. Curiosity and skepticism will continue to bring wave upon wave of people to these joints and nothing will stop them. Their popularity has reached Paris Hilton-esque proportions where any publicity is good publicity.

What bothers me is the fact that people differentiate Pat's and Geno's as two separate entities, when it is clear that they both are equal establishments. What angers me the most is that Pat's and Geno's are famous for how delicious their cheese steaks are rather than notorious for how atrociously terrible they really are.

My wife stood on line at Pat's for me while I was at Geno's.  Her line moved slightly quicker and the staff was very accommodating and let her wait for me as they took people ahead of her and then allowed us to order when I was able to get over there, without having to wait on line all over again.  I think I read reviews saying they were rude, this proved to me they are not rude.  I ordered a cheese steak wit onions, whiz and mushrooms.  All I can say is, after eating only 1/2 of the sandwich right there (had to save room for 1/2 of the Geno's for a head-to-head), it was hands down one of the best I have ever had.  I have had equal to it, outside of philly, but it only disappointed in that I had hoped it was better than what I have had before.  I only gave 4 stars (again, I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could) because I am holding out hope that there is a better cheese steak sandwich out there, but this is as good as I have had anywhere.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

They are using their reputation as a way to serve mediocre, dry, tasteless meat covered in salty cheesewhiz on an okay bun. The portion is skimpy ... the price is insanely high for what you get and the staff is rude. I honestly would put this on par with Subway. Yet, each time I find myself in Philly, it's usually at a time where this is the only option for a cheesesteak and I forget how bad it was until I order it again.

The day before I ate here this time, there was a shooting outside the restaurant. While the neighborhood is MUCH improved from even 5 years ago, it's still nowhere you want to wander around in alone after dark. There are lots of scammers outside as well. Kids will come up to you asking you to buy a candy bar for their football team. You give them a buck or two and they pretty much tell you to fuck off. Don't fall for it. They'll wait until you have your wallet out after paying and then hit you up for the donation.

The parking situation is insane. I'd suggest parking in the nearby CVS lot, which is somewhat protected, and walking over if you must go here. The street parking spots are amazingly tight and most of the cars have pretty good amounts of 'battle wounds'. Even if you can parallel park like a champ, you may come out and find your car worse for the wear.

So what exactly is a cheesesteak here like? A dry, overcooked and void of seasoning or taste pile of meat. Melted cheap American cheese or orange salty Cheez Whiz. The dry roll is the best part of the sandwich but there is so few meat in it that all you'll taste is roll and melted cheese. You'll likely be full after and can walk across the street to Geno's, which is another tourist trap serving below mediocre cheesesteaks.

There are far better places in Philly to grab a cheesesteak. The local spots are likely the best ... Campos in Reading Market also does a decent one. Unless you want to say you've been here or there's no place else open, you'd likely do better in your hometown at a pizza or sub shoppe than at this tourist trap. No credit cards in 2021 as well.

And I knew I had to check out THE Pat's King of Steaks, the OG of the Philly Cheesesteak.  I made a list and checked it twice, I was to come here, then cross the street and try Geno's and eventually visit a few other places to triangulate the cheesesteak data.

My control sandwich at all FOUR places (that's right, I went to 4 places in two days), was a cheesesteak with whiz and onions.  Pure and simple.

Since I felt a deft sense of respect for Pat's, I wanted to like this sandwich a lot more than I actually did.  By no means was it bad or a total disappointment, but I also didn't feel like I had to travel 99 miles from New York to eat this thing.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but did it blow my socks off?  Not in the least.  And to be honest, I really WAS wearing socks.

The setup is a bit uncouth.  The sidewalk red tables and benches remind me of  Coney Island -- when it was dirtier (think back to the 90's).  The few piegons loitering around also added to that visual rendition.  The guys here don't really want to crack a smile at you, they're not exactly rude, but they also don't appear to care that you've come a long way to try their famed cheesesteak.  Whatever.  Kill my fairytale.  

If the cheesesteak itself was amazeballs, I don't care how dumpy the place, or the surrounding neighborhood was, I would have gleefully embraced it all.  But the meat was chewy, there wasn't enough whiz & onions on my steak, and it just wasn't memorable.  And we had to pay $8.00 for that.  

In my grand tally of the four cheesesteak joints we went to (Pat's, Geno's, Ishkabibble's, and Jim's Steaks), I would place Pat's tied for 3rd place.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Pat's King of Steaks was a very underwhelming experience. Where do I start? There was nothing amazing about this. The unoriginal beef flavor, the average bun, the lack of seasoning. This cheesesteak started okay but tasted worse with each bite. Ive never hated meat but by the end of this sandwich I felt like throwing up a little bit. My girlfriend felt the same way to. I imagine this is food tailored for drunk college kids at 3am on a friday night. 

The amount of cheese is generous and the sandwich was the largest of any cheesesteak I ate in the city.Staff is super nice as well. Standard cheesesteak prices, about $10 but not worth it. Food is solid 1.5 but other perks bumped it up

It is a tourist trap, however, it is in the middle of a residential neighborhood that is full of locals.  It is the original, but has been surpassed by other places.  In my opinion, Pats is worth the visit due to the nostalgia.   To get here you have to drive thorough one way streets with cars parked on both sides of the street.  Parking is a nightmare here, no parking garages, strictly street parking.  I highly suggest you come at odd hours like we did at 10:00am, it is open for 24hrs.  We had to drive around and wait until someone moves, you have to be quick and really know how to parallel park.  Otherwise, I highly recommend taking a cab.  Near where you order is a walk of fame for Rocky Balboa where he stood.  The neighborhood is quite quaint and the art work is on the buildings is very authentic, again one of the few spots that, I have been to that draws tourists but is located in the heart of where the locals live.  

We ordered a mushroom cheesesteak and a regular cheesesteak.  The proper way to order a cheesesteak is you first designate the number of sandwiches along with the type of cheese.  For us it was two whiz.  Than you specify whether you would like onions or not, so our order was ""two whiz, one wit, one wit out.""  Place is cash only and again lines are long, have your order ready and cash ready.  The cheesesteaks themselves were good, good quality meat, and melted cheese whiz speaks for itself.  The bread they use is a white hoagie, and is a lot more chewy than John's bread, and John's has a much better selection of cheeses'.

And many-a-time, these same people would want to try both Pat's and Geno's, so I've definitely had both plenty of times.

I always get the mushroom steak with whiz and onions (yes I know there's a Philly way of ordering but seriously? I refuse). 

The meat at Pat's is better. The steak is more tender and juicy. I like the juices that run down your arm as you eat the sandwich. It's salty, it's warm, it's great after-drinking food. 

I almost always also get an order of cheese fries (just because the whiz on my sandwich isn't quite enough whiz yet) and an order of Birch Beer (kind of like root beer) which goes oh-so-well with the cheesesteak.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

What can I say that hasn't already been said?  If you visit Philadelphia, this is a requirement.

If you are expecting your life to be transformed based on the taste alone, you will be disappointed.  That being said, I've never had a better Cheese Steak.  

The entire Philadelphia culture is engulfed at Pat's, and I mean that in the most affectionate way.  Here is the routine:

1) Stand in line.

2) Use this time to decide on your order.

3) Practice reciting your order under your breath.

4) Arrive at the front of the line where someone behind the counter will barely acknowledge your presence.

5) Proclaim, ""Whiz Wit, fries and a drink"" within the first second and a half of said vague acknowledgment.

Cheesesteaks are our favorite sandwich, and we've had the best of what Syracuse has to offer. (Spoiler alert: None of them are in the same league.) Through our visit, we had marked five places to get cheesesteaks while in town. Genos and Pats were more for their history and relevance than anything else, but it was nice starting here and working our way up.

We had stopped by Geno's the night before since all the other places were closed. The next morning we came to Pats, since none of the places were open yet. I love that they have the food ready less than 20 seconds after you've placed the order. Wrapped and everything, but still assembled fresh. We also appreciated that they broke down the cheesesteak jargon on posters for us ignorant outsiders. We got our cheesesteak ""wiz wit"". Wiz for the cheese, which we had never heard of until coming to Philly. ""Wit"" meaning ""wit onions"", as opposed to ""wit out"". We loved it in Philly.

The bread was soft, and the onions were cooked all the way. The meat was in full, thin chewy slices. They don't cut the sandwiches in half, which was unfortunate for us because we ate this one in the car outside of Swann Memorial Fountain. The sandwich was messy to the touch, it took some serious doing to get this thing into two pieces and eat it without cheesing up the whole car. But we managed, and we'd do it again.

We voted Genos over Pats, and all other places over both. There's a lot of Kitsch surrounding both ""original"" locations, and it's made them both soft. Still though, absolutely no complaint coming from out of town. My rating of 3/5 is based on context. I'd go out of my way to eat at Pat's any day if it were in Syracuse, but I'll never come back now that I know what else is available in Philadelphia.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Anyway, my husband and I got 2 cheese steaks: one with cheese whiz and the other with provolone. We also got french fries and a soda.

PROS: Food comes out quick 
CONS: Quick food has its consequences. Our cheese steaks barely had any cheese!!! Our onions were slapped on one side of the sandwich. Also, the steak is just really bland!! No taste whatsoever. Hurry up and eat your sandwich quick because it wont taste any better cold! The fries literally had nooo taste! Most likely ccooked in really old batter. Youre definitely going to have a hard time finding a place to sit. The concession area where they have their peppers, ketchup, mustard, etc. looks very unsanitary with flies.

We ordered a Philly cheesesteak and we both were underwhelmed. The fries are already made and are sitting on a stand already in a cup so as you can imagine they were cold. The cheesesteak wasn't very cheesy or flavorful. Overall, I think I ate a few disappointing bites and then called it quits. Tossed it in the trash and headed to go get something good to eat.

I know that so many people have such varying, strong opinions on which place has the best cheesesteak in Philly, which just means that it's a very personal choice--and I guess this review gives me the opportunity to explain mine.

First off is the food - which is the real reason why we are here, right? To me, Pat's steaks are perfection - it's meaty and pretty lean and flavorful, the bread roll is delicious, the cheese is always on point, and those bursting red cherry peppers seal the deal for a great sandwich. The fries remind me of crispy, thicker Burger King fries, which is awesome in my book (they seem to be coated with some kind of sparse batter that adds to their crispness). 

My own particular ""pièce de résistance' is the basic cheesesteak wit onions and provolone. It's a testament to how good this item is when I don't need to order it as a pizza steak (which is my typically favorite cheesesteak sandwich). Sorry Philly diehards, I'm just not a cheese wiz kinda guy, and never will be. 

Which leads me to point #2 - my mind is stimulated, my tastebuds are happy, and my tummy is full when I leave Pats. IMHO $11 is getting pricey for a cheesesteak, but at least I'm content when I'm done with my meal here. You just can't underestimate how much that particular mix means to a consumer. If you feel more fulfilled after shelling out your hard-earned dollars, then it's a great place to be. As I sit in the outdoors seating with friends, basking in our glow of grease digesting through our arteries, we have great chats through the energy of tons of people that swirl around us.

And point #3 being that Pat's location is vibrant and energetic. Sure, Pat's is a tourist trap; but it's easy to deal with when you've enjoyed the food and it's a fun to place to be with happy tourists abound. I guess this is why Pat's has a long history here in the City - because it's genuine and people are drawn to it because of that. Even Pat's building is much more modest than Geno's neon-clad pretentiousness (I don't mean to start a civil war here!). Pat's may be a tourist trap, other places may arguably have better quality ingredients overall, but there aren't many places left in the city to get a fun cheesesteak experience for under $11. 

There are very few spots in this City that I think of as my 'happy places' - places that balance delicious food with reasonable prices and great surroundings - but Pat's does happen to be one of them.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Meat:
Pat's: The meat at Pat's is shredded and there is a bountiful amount 
Geno's: The meat is sliced and extremely tender

Cheese:
Pat's: way to much cheese wiz on the sandwich almost a full on cheese sandwich 
Geno's: cheese wiz wiped on the sides of the bread and just a little added to the meat

Bread:
Pat's: Soft but not as good as Geno's in my opinion
Geno's: Soft and soaked up all the juices from the meat creating a soft luxurious sandwich 

The fries here at Pat's were delicious I must say and had a great flavor over all. I also really liked their choices of soft drinks. Any place that serves birch beer is a winner in my book.

As you can read in my review of Geno's, the establishment kiddy corner from Pat's, the xenophobic bigotry was a turn off enough to not even want to eat there, but the food was also bad.  Pat's was just higher quality, period.

The service was great.  The guy that takes your steak order is a little hard to understand, but he totally gets the job done if you make sure to read the sign that says ""How to Order.""  If you're ready when you get to the window, he'll mumble what he needs to and ask for your money.  Definitely not rude service and ordering is really, really quick.

Looking for a Philly Cheesesteak? Well this one is your typical Philly Cheesesteak.  Between this place and the one next to it, Geno's I'd go with Pat's. 

Pat's is known to be one of the famous Philly Cheesesteak spots, and while the cheesesteaks are not bad and a good size, there have been many other cheesesteak spots in Philly that have popped up which in my opinion serve superior cheesesteaks.  However, do not get me wrong, with all the lights and glamor here, a tourist will not be disappointed.  

As a tourist tip, make sure you order this way for prompt service:

Step 1: Mention if you want onions on your steak
Step 2: Specify type of cheese (plain, Cheez Wiz, Provolone, American, or Pizza-style) Step 3: Pay (CASH ONLY!) 
Step 4: First window is for ordering your steak only, while the second window is for fries and drinks.

I've lived in Philly now for six years, and everything you've heard about Pat's is true. They are the original and they are fantastic. The service is speedy-speedy, especially because there are two windows: one for your steak sandwich, and the other is your drinks/fries. You just walk right up and order (for me, it's a whiz witout), the steak is fresh and ready to go, he slaps the whiz on the roll and in maybe ten seconds or less you're ready to go.

Something people never talk about, though, is the price... It's a little way pricey, like over $9.00 for a cheese steak, but for a taste of classic Philadelphia, it's definitely worth trying if you're in the area. The way I figure, you're not just paying for the steak sandwich, you're also paying for the right to say ""I've had a true Philly cheese steak"". You're paying for the ambiance, the experience... But don't get me wrong, the cheese steak itself is certainly worthy of the price.

It's definitely a little tourist-y, especially because of just how famous it is, but that's not really a problem. There's plenty of seating, and it's relatively easy to get to. If you're driving in, odds are you won't find a parking spot, but that's generally true no matter where you are in the city. But the Broad Street Line stops right nearby, so it's a nice place to have lunch if you're already out.

I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said among the hundreds of other reviews. Though my one review is merely a drop in the bucket relative to the total amount there are, that in itself speaks to the sheer quality of Pat's Steaks.

I honestly just went with my friends' recommendation. Geno's looks pretty flashy with all them lights around it, while Pat's looks like it hasn't changed forever.

If you're coming for a quick snack, be prepared to wait in line for about half and hour, but just rest assured. It's well worth the wait. One thing that your should note is that there are two lines. The long one is JUST for cheesesteaks, while the other, shorter line is for drinks and french fries. 

Wiz Wit. Just remember those two words and you're set. Cheese wiz on a sandwich makes ALL the difference. I've had cheesesteaks with provolone and other cheeses, but cheese wiz is definitely the way to go. The guys here literally just slap the wiz onto your cheesesteak. One of these babies will run you around $9, which is so worth the money. By the time you finish waiting in line, you're ready to scarf this thing down. The meat is both juicy and loose. Because the meat is chopped up, it's easy to eat and bit into. I think I ended up killing off my cheesesteak in less than 5 minutes. I don't have much that I can compare Pat's to, but shoot, this is definitely the best cheesesteak that I've ever had. If you're coming to Philly, then this place is a must. 

Cash only here, so be prepared to come with at least $10 a person. Parking is all street parking, so be prepared to search for a spot like a hawk.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

I was surprised to find that a cheesesteak was $10, but shrugged it off. Pat's is most certainly a tourist spot, but it's not a trap. These cheesesteak are most definitely original Philly-style cheesesteaks and won't shatter any dreams. 

Are they the best? Probably not. Do they satisfy my cheesesteak craving? Yes. 

That being said, Pat's is much better late at night than during the day. There is almost no line and, more importantly, the steak is chopped to order. This makes for a less-dry and tenderer steak. The onion's aren't too overwhelming and mingles well with the wiz. Some complain that there is too much wiz and not enough onion; they should try Geno's.

Today at lunch I grabbed an Indego bike and pedaled off to South Philly. On a Thursday at 1:00, there was hardly a line, and it moved efficiently, what with the cut-and-dry ordering process. 

My ""whiz wit"" slid toward me, pushed by an apathetic older guy who was already on to the next customer, and I took it to one of the red metal tables on the shady side of the shop. It was smaller than expected, especially for $10. (And not cut in half, to the disappointment of anyone planning to send someone to Geno's and then do a half-and-half comparison.) 

It tasted good. Not great, but decent. It was sloppily made, with the meat scarce in spots. The cheese whiz just disappeared into it. The onions were a bit...oniony. Almost raw, but not terrible. I pulled several bits of unchewable beef out of my mouth--hard fatty stuff. As cheesesteaks go, I've had better. But now I've done it at least.

Most of the people eating there seemed like tourists. Lots of photos being snapped. Across the intersection sat Geno's, no line, lots of open seats. Next time, I guess.

My cheesesteak was gone before I knew it. I considered getting cheese fries too, but that would make my lunch $16, and I can have a decent dinner at a restaurant for that, so I just hopped back on my city bike and pedaled back to work, 2 miles away.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

You're pressured to make quick decisions on what you want which can lead to disappointment.  It's worth noting their default cheese is cheese whiz which is disgusting. The steak was incredibly greasy and there's almost no seating.  We walked around the fenced in park and found nowhere to sit around there either so this is probably best enjoyed if you can stand and eat at the same time.  Overall bland but I'm sure it hits the spot  if you are hung over.,"Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

Even though the cooking is a bit different. I still wait theirs! My normal preferred options are the simple with onion & Provolone cheese. Both missing mozzarella though!! Adding their banana peppers if you like it spiced is good option too! No ketchup!!,"Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"

After spending $53 for the ""steaks"" and another $32 for three french fries and four drinks I felt like my family got robbed. The meat had ZERO flavor and the peppers and onions were just grilled peppers and onions. Not sure what people love about these mediocre at best sandwiches.","Italian, American (Traditional), Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants, Local Flavor, Cheesesteaks"
